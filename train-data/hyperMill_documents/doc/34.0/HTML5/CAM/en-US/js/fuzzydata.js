If automatic model checking is switched off, it can be performed separately for each job via the job or joblist’s shortcut menu. Regardless of this setting, a model check is always carried out before generating the toolpaths. Licensing License status : Shows the status of your hyper MILL licenses. All products : Locked and available products are displayed. Locked products : Only locked products are displayed. Licensed products : Only available (and licensed) products are displayed. If you work with network licenses, you can reserve specific licenses for your computer when you start hyper MILL. Select the product that you want to lock and enable the Lock on start option. For more information on network installations, refer to the installation guide for your product. Show locked products only: When you create a new job, only those products that are available for your computer (locked products) are displayed. 2D compatibility Limit 2D jobs to NCS : You cannot select frames in 2D jobs. Select this setting if you are only going to program on the NCS (program zero point) and your postprocessor is not suitable for multi-axis indexing. Default paths Paths for saving files generated with hyper MILL. Use the following icons to make changes. Add\/remove directory. Change path. Global Working Space : Location for storing all data that is generated by hyper MILL (toolpaths, models, databases and so on). Changes are possible only using the hyper MILL SettingsWizard (hmInit.exe). hyperMILL search path : The directories are set by default but can be changed if required. Once paths have been correctly set here, only the name of each file needs to be entered for all further processes. Temporary files : Only temporary files needed within the program, including, for example, boundary files ( *.bnd ), profile files ( *.prf ) and calculation files for individual cycles ( *.omx ). Configuration files : User-specific default settings. Projects : Files will be stored in this directory if you have selected the Project directories option on the Document dialog page of the Setup hyper MILL dialog. 3DF files : Directory for polyhedron files (mathematical collision models for calculating toolpaths). Hmrep files : Directory for temporary geometry data. Stock files : Directory for stock files in *.STL or *.VIS format. Toolpaths : Directory for toolpaths with information that is required to generate an NC program. Backup files : Directory for *.hyperMILL backup files.

AddIns : Not used currently. AUTOMATION Center : Default path to store data generated or used by the AUTOMATION Center , such as fixtures, features, stock models or reports. Turret setup : Directory for saving exported turret setup. Performance Use all CPU resources for cycle computing : The majority of cycles support multi-core processors and perform calculations in parallel. If this option is selected, all of your computer's CPU resources will be used for cycle computing. Please note that the simultaneous use of hyper MILL for interactive work during a calculation may slow down the system. If the option is not selected, a part of your computer's CPU resources will be available during cycle computing for simultaneous hyper MILL use, which means that toolpath calculation may be slowed down as a result. Backup The Activate option allows hyper MILL to create backup copies of the CAD model files used ( *.hmc \/ *.e3 ). Backup files are created as: [Original file name]_ [n].hmc.hyperMILL To open a backup file in hyper MILL, change the file extension to *.hmc \/ *.e3 . Number of backup copies per document : Specifies the number of backup copies per CAD model file. At present, you can create up to 999 backup copies. Each time you save the model file, a backup copy is created. Once the maximum number of backup copies is reached, the backup copy created first is overwritten. Save backup in user-defined folder : Backup files are saved in a user-defined directory. This directory is either the directory displayed under Default paths Backup files or (if the Project directories option has been enabled on the Document dialog page) in the corresponding project directory . Save backup in same folder as original : Backup files are saved in the same folder as the original file. " },

The assignment of the frame to a job takes place in the job definition. (1) NC system (2-4) Frames All frames must be defined before generating the toolpaths. Subsequent movement or rotation will mean having to recalculate all tool paths affected by the change. If the NC system is modified, then the entire job list has to be recalculated. If frames are modified, the affected jobs must be recalculated. Correct job definition and therefore machining can be achieved only if the frame is in the correct position and orientation for the job, because: All definitions for the vertical machining area are in relation to the frame (top, bottom), clearance distance, XY plane, horizontal stepover. The frame shares responsibility for collision checking during machining. Surfaces that cannot be recognized from the tool axis perspective (1) are not machined. In hyper MILL, the first point of a toolpath can also lie below the level given by the height of the machining side in the z+ direction. This generally means below the uppermost point in the model. The positioning movements made by the machine axes up to this first point are not represented in the toolpath, but defined in the postprocessor. An OPEN MIND postprocessor positions the rotational axes first, and only then proceeds to the first point of the toolpath along the linear axes. This needs to be taken into particular consideration during 5X programming, for example, when linking with the Clearance mode Radial option or when linking triaxial toolpaths with differently oriented frames.

To open the dialog page Corrected Output System , the function Job List Settings NCS select. Best Fit More complex part shapes, alternative manufacturing processes (casting, 3D printing, forged stock) and smaller allowances make manually aligning the part very time-consuming. The hyper MILL Best Fit alignment eliminates the need for time-consuming manual alignment measures. Positioning is automatic and based on the internal origin shift captured using the 3D Point Probing cycle. Probing takes place both in the CAM programming and on the machine, so that the position deviation between the virtual and the real situation can be determined and corrected. The Best Fit real part position is adjusted in the VIRTUAL Machining Center and is checked for collisions. An attempt is made to comply with all machine limits with the help of the NC optimizer. Corrected output system In series production or workshop use, OPEN MIND generally recommends Best Fit adjustment via the VIRTUAL Machining Center . For single parts, prototypes or large toolpath files, the zero point can already be corrected in hyper MILL . The shift is transferred directly to the VIRTUAL Machining Center which means that the real position has already been adjusted. After the collision check and release, the NC program can be executed on the real position. Active correction : Select the checkbox to create a corrected output system. From probing log file : Enable if there is a log file that was created using the Best Fit function of the VIRTUAL Machining Center . Manual Definition : Use the function Define Correction to manually enter values for Moving and Rotation . Preferably used for uneven, smaller allowances. Use frame : Select a frame that was created with the help of the From probing log file function. Correction to reference system The deviations of the newly calculated corrected output system from the reference system are displayed as Angle values for A, B and C and as deviations from the Origin in the X, Y and Z directions. The displayed values cannot be edited. Create frame based on correction : This function creates a new frame on the Frames dialog page of the hyper MILL browser that was generated using the From probing log file function. Open the Calculate corrected output system dialog via the Calculate correction function. The following functions are available: Select 3D Point Probing report File : Select a measuring log file generated by hyper MILL in *.ompr or *.log format. Minimize distance between points To align the component optimally on the machine, minimize the distance between the model positions and the real positions on the machine. The distance can be minimized with the function Surfaces (distance along normals) along the surface normals of the component. To be used for relatively uniform allowances. Minimize the distance with the function Surfaces (distance enclosing normals) along the surface normals, especially for optimum alignment of components\/stock models with uneven, small allowances in different areas. The deviation of the measuring points from the target dimension is determined in the direction of the surface normals (A). The component\/stock model is moved for optimum alignment independently of the surface normals (B). (1) = Target part, (2) measured undersize of the aligned stock model, (3) stock model to be aligned, (4) stock model optimally aligned with the function Surfaces (distance enclosing normals) . Alternatively, the distance between the measured values of the points can also be minimized using the function Points (3D distance) . To be used if several axes are locked. Only the distances are minimized, the surface normals are not taken into account. Axis : Axis of the reference zero point. Locking : Lock the axes that are not to be moved when calculating the optimal clamping position on the machine. To do this, click the field for the required axis. After reading the measuring log file, use the Best Fit preview function to visualize the precision of the component alignment. The Best Fit preview function shows the virtually corrected alignment (measuring points) taking into account the selected Best Fit calculation method. The selected measuring log file is used (see dialog Calculate corrected output system ) and the transformed measuring points are automatically displayed on the Probing tab in hyper MILL CAD . The corrected output system is automatically used when the NC file is created. The job does not need to be recalculated. The corrected position of the component is not shown in the graphics area of the CAD system. The component and stock position is checked exclusively in  VIRTUAL Machining Center .

The active Output origin is displayed as graphical feedback in the CAD window. Example of use Contour Milling on 3D Model- Transformations To machine a contour on four different sides of a cube in a job, for example, you just have to program this on one side. The other three sides of the cube are machined automatically by transformation. To do this in the job definition, proceed as follows: Create an origin for each side to be machined. Then create a frame for each origin using the New frame from origin shortcut menu. Make the required settings in each of the job dialogs. Make sure that the correct frame (defined for the contour) is set in the Tool Frame area. Then switch to the Transformation dialog page. Define a General pattern where you specify each of the previously defined (origin-based) frames as the target reference system . Switch to the Transformation dialog page of the job definition, set the transformation to Active , disable the Keep original job option and select the Use job frame option under Start reference . In the calculation that follows, hyperMILL transforms the contour defined on the one side of the cube to three other sides of the cube and therefore allows complete machining of all sides of the cube in a single job. Please note, that you need a special license to use this function. Please contact your OPEN MIND partner.

Depending on which template has been selected, the CAM Plan contains different functions and tasks. Use the \/ icons in the tree structure to control the visibility of elements. To avoid possible issues during programming, all the tasks offered should be carried out. General (complementary) : Use the \/ icons to control the visibility of all geometries not selected as a part. Part : Select the surfaces of the part to be programmed without unnecessary additional surfaces or capping of holes. Then go through the tasks step by step to fully prepare the part. Remove duplicate surfaces : Check the part for duplicate surfaces and remove them if applicable. Check surfaces : Check the selectedsur surfaces for possible defects that could cause problems in the subsequent programming process. If a damaged surface is found, the first step is to attempt to repair the surface automatically. In the next step, a new layer is created, the corresponding surface is moved there and removed from the selection made in  Part . Ensure that this or any newly constructed surface is included in the part selection again. hyper MILL  converter check : Check whether the selected part can be converted by the converter. Check for gaps : Check whether there are gaps between the selected surfaces. If gaps are found, a layer is automatically created upon which the gaps are displayed using curves and points. Decide whether the gaps should be corrected or not. Skip this task by deactivating the corresponding option at  Computable task . Orientate surfaces : Check whether the selected surfaces are correctly orientated. After starting the task, the corresponding CAD function opens automatically and aligns the surfaces. Manually align any surfaces that are not aligned correctly. The corresponding surfaces are displayed in a dark color. Hole recognition \/ add capping : This task starts the Feature mapping based on the selection made for the Part . Capping surfaces are automatically created for the recognized holes, a new layer is created and the surfaces are moved there. Skip this task by deactivating the corresponding option at  Computable task . Create milling area(s) : The milling areas required for programming are created automatically. One or two milling areas are created depending on the selected project template. If the \"with holes\" template has been selected, two milling areas are created: A milling area that contains the part and the holes, and a milling area that contains no holes but the capping. If a template \"without holes\" has been selected, only one milling area is created. High precision milling : Select all surfaces that are relevant as product surfaces for 3D finishing and generate topology information from them. The generated curves represent the exact topology information of the product surfaces. They are saved internally and used for the point distribution of 3D finishing. Deburring : Select all surfaces as edge surfaces that are relevant for deburring the component and create the edge geometries for deburring. These curves are saved internally and used for the toolpath calculation of the 5X Deburring and 5X Hole Deburring cycles. " },

The 2D Curve is used to guide the tool, see NC safety - interactive 2D Curve . Linking movements take place at the Linking height , see NC safety - interactive Linking height . If the Prefer general safety function is activated, hyper MILL automatically decides between variants (A) and (B), whereby (A) is generally used so long as the tool length is sufficiently short and the Z axis limits are not violated. Otherwise, variant (B) is used. Example BC kinematics, Contouring using 3D Free Path Milling, (1) Contours to be machined, (2) 2D Curve for guiding the tool, (3) Security plane , (4) Linking height . Axial security distance : Distance to be maintained between the tool and part in the axial direction. The defined value is taken into account when the Optimize clearance plane option is enabled. Example BC kinematics, (1) Height of the clearance plane. Security plane : The height of the security plane is calculated to the given clamping position. The value should be selected so that all rotary axes of the machine can be moved without a collision. For table-head, head-head kinematics as well as for kinematics with more than 5 axes, the direction of the security plane can be defined. Example BC kinematics, (1) Height of the security plane (2) Side view, (3) Top view, B axis rotated by 90 degrees. Optimize clearance plane : When generating the NC file, the NC Optimizer trims the rapids from and to the hyper MILL job clearance plane to the mandatory length. This avoids problems due to end position violations. Example BC kinematics, (1) Clearance plane not optimized, X axis limit exceeded, (2) Clearance plane optimized, X axis limit maintained, (3) Linking movement. Smooth linking : Optionally, the link rapids, including connections with alternating inclination, are made using a natural movement that is adapted to the machine kinematics. The optimization of the hyper MILL job clearance planes is automatically activated during smooth linking. Use dynamic stock:  Only available if the  Smooth linking  function is activated. An updated stock is created for each job in the job list, which is considered for linking movements so that they are collision-free. The function is deactivated by default.

"body" : "[video] Define a manual pre-rotation of the C axis before the start of the job with the Preferred solution C-Axis (A\/B = 0) \/ Preferred solution C-Axis turning (A\/B = 0) function. This makes it possible to manually avoid axis limit violations or collision situations. Example 1: 2D Milling BC kinematics : The function Preferred solution C-Axis (A\/B = 0) Angle is set to 180. This ensures that the C axis is rotated to 180 degrees before the start of the job to stop the axis limits from being exceeded. Tool position inside X axis limit (1), tool position outside X axis limit (2). Example 2: Milling with rotation axis The function Preferred solution C-Axis (A\/B = 0) Axis change is set to 90°. This ensures that an XY milling movement is converted into a milling movement with rotation axis and linear axis (e.g. CX). Control the position of the tool by changing the value for the angle. The basic position 0° refers to the X+ axis of the NCS. The value for the angle is a solid angle (counterclockwise). If the specified value for the milling position leads to a problem, such as an axis limitation, an optimization is automatically carried out by the NC Optimizer . Requirement : The Use NC optimizer function is enabled in the machine properties dialog. (1) Axis change = 0°, (2) axis change = 90° The option Preferred solution C-axis (A\/B=0) Axis change is enabled and the value for the angle is 90°. The option Preferred solution C-Axis (A\/B = 0) Frame is enabled. Example 3: Drilling AC kinematics The function Preferred solution C-Axis (A\/B = 0) Angle is set to 0 (1). The function Preferred solution C-Axis (A\/B = 0) Angle is set to 45 (2). This rotates the C axis clockwise by 45 degrees before the job starts. Example 4: Turning AC kinematics : The function Preferred solution C-Axis turning (A\/B = 0) Angle is set to 0 (degrees) (1). The function Preferred solution C-Axis turning (A\/B = 0) Angle is set to 45 (degrees) (2). This rotates the machining position by 45 degrees. Frame : The NC output and the C axis position correspond to the frame selected in the job. Transform polar : Only available for lathes and turn-mill machines. The NC output is via the C-X axis and the corresponding functions in the control. Axis change : The angle entered defines the position of the milling tool during machining. The NC output is via RTCP and a rotary axis. Output is only possible in the G17 inclination. Force : When the NC Optimizer is activated, the specified C axis is generally taken into account, however, the NC Optimizer may make a different choice for different reasons (axis limits exceeded, collision avoidance). This behavior of the NC Optimizer is disabled by the Force option and the C axis is always pre-turned. " },

In 3D machining, it is not possible to resolve a collision involving the tool extension , holder and\/or spindle by extending the tool (see calculating the tool length) or a collision will occur with the thick shank . If a collision cannot be avoided by changing the tool orientation (5X) or tool length calculation, various options are available for the machining strategies: Stop : The toolpath calculation stops when a collision occurs (applies for all machining strategies). Clip : The toolpath is fully calculated. Only the collision-free areas of the toolpaths are output. As a result of rework machining with another tool and\/or another tool inclination, the toolpaths found in the collision can be tracked and checked for collisions (applies to all 3D machining strategies). Collision avoidance : With this option, the tool is side-stepped to avoid collision so that the material can be machined as deeply as possible with the most robust possible tool. The toolpaths calculated for the Clip option are used as the basis for the 3D Rework Machining cycle. An area is determined and graphically displayed within the 3D Automatic Rest Machining cycle.

If the defined value (default = 91°) is exceeded or it is equal to the defined value, the linking movement between the two machining areas takes place at the height of the clearance plane, even if Clearance distance is defined as the retract mode (Parameters dialog page) (1). If the angle value falls below the defined value, the linking movement takes place at the height of the clearance distance (dialog page: Parameters) (2).

Clearance straighten angle : If the angle between the Z axis of the current machining frame and Z axis of the tool is greater than the defined straighten angle (default = 45°), the tool turns to the defined value for the straighten angle, after it has reached the clearance plane. If the angle between the Z axis of the current machining frame and Z axis of the tool is smaller than or equal to the defined Straighten angle, the tool moves to the clearance plane without changing the tool inclination (3).

No optimization : No jobs are optimized. The sequence of all job steps remains the same. Optimization with job grouping : Macro jobs are sorted taking into account the tool sequence within macros. Jobs with different features but the same tool and the same job parameters are combined into one job step. Optimization without job grouping : Macro jobs are sorted taking into account the tool sequence within macros. Identical job steps with the same tool are not combined into one job step. The job steps are sorted in the order of the tool calls in macros. Manually created jobs, which are located between macro jobs, remain at their positions in the job list. Tool Sorting Optimize macro jobs. Manually created jobs are not optimized. Requirement: The option Optimization Optimization with job grouping or Optimization Optimization without job grouping is enabled. No sorting : No change in the sequence of tool calls. With ascending and descending sorting, the logical order of the tools within the macro has top priority, which means that sorting may not always be maintained correctly or the same tool may be changed twice. Sort by ascending diameter : Taking into account the macro order, the tools used are sorted in ascending order by diameter. Example : In a component with holes D6, D8, D9 and M10, the holes D6 and D8 are drilled first, then the core hole for M10 with D8.5 and finally the hole D9. The order within a macro is not changed. Sort by descending diameter : Taking into account the order within a macro, the tools used are sorted in descending order by diameter.

"body" : "Prerequisites for multi axis indexing: A machine with C axis and\/or swiveling milling head (5X machining). A drawing in the form of a 3D model. Programming always takes place in the G17 workplane: Infeed in (negative) Z direction; Z axis is perpendicular to the machining side Machining in the XY direction. Hence in multi-axis machining, you first have to define the coordinate system and the frame for each machining side. See the information in section NC system and frames . Machine cycle definition The job sequence is basically arbitrary. If a tool change optimization is required, the definition should be made one page at a time (shorter calculation time). To do this, open the machining cycle, set the required frame in the Setup input dialog and define the job's machining parameters. At any given time, only the current frame is visible in the CAD drawing. Only those contours that lie on the frame's XY plane can be selected. Tool change optimization Before generating the toolpaths, it is possible to optimize tool changes by sorting individual jobs according to different criteria. Macro job lists for holes must be expanded into individual jobs prior to tool change optimization. Use the Explode function on the shortcut menu for this. It is possible to sort by different criteria. Use the function you require from the joblist’s shortcut menu. Sort by tool : Starting with the first tool in the expanded joblist (drilling cycles expanded into individual drillings), the jobs are sorted by tool number in ascending order, regardless of the frame in the job. The job sequence can also be sorted again manually. Sort by frame : The jobs are sorted by frame number. The job and tool sequence already defined for each frame is retained. " },

Circular pattern in the plane with 5-axis postprocessor Depending on the settings, the postprocessor outputs a different table\/head orientation for each position, if required. Additional movements occur between all copies, which correspond to a safe positioning logic of the machine. Linking movements created by the postprocessor are not collision-checked against the 3D model. You therefore need to ensure that the clearance plane is above all collision-relevant elements. Using the frame ID for postprocessors If your postprocessor requires you to define a frame ID or a frame comment , your postprocessor is incompatible with toolpaths that were created using the hyper MILL Transformation function. For this reason, please only use toolpaths without transformations for these postprocessors. Structuring the NC output For recurring toolpaths that were created using transformations , a simplified NC output is not generally provided (for example, as a subprogram or part of the program that repeats). If you wish to have a suitable simplified NC output, contact your OPEN MIND dealer. Please also bear in mind that a fee may be required for postprocessor enhancements. For toolpaths generated by a transformation , only one safety check with a tolerance of 0.05 mm will be carried out.

Limitations : Climb milling becomes Conventional milling and vice versa, no collision check is performed, not available for compound job or job list, but only for an individual job. You can use a mirror in a job, compound job or job list. Advantages Full associativity between the base geometry and the mirrored element (job, compound job or job list) No limitations for 2D, 3D and 5X machining Flexibility as a result of partial deactivation of the direct link between the base element and the mirrored element Retention of technology parameters (such as auto climb, automatic macros or optimized linking movements) in the mirror. Patterns can be combined. The mirroring of turning jobs is not possible due to a risk of collision. This also applies to the Turning drilling mode in drilling cycles. Climb milling\/Conventional milling When mirroring curve machinings in the 2D Contour Milling, 3D Free Path Milling and 5X Contouring cycles, a distinction is drawn between whether machining takes place to the side of the contour (options: Left \/ Right ) or on the contour (option: On contour) . (1) When machining takes place on the contour, the curve is mirrored, including the start point, to guarantee geometrically symmetric material removal. (2) When machining takes place at the side of the contour, the direction of the contour in the mirroring is inverted to also guarantee equal climb to the contour in the mirrored machining. " },

"body" : "The Milling area or Turning area defines the area of the CAD model to be machined that is checked for collisions at the same time. The Fixture area is also checked for collisions; this includes those areas of the CAD model that are used to fix the part during machining. hyper MILL automatically generates a polyhedron model (3DF format) at a suitably high surface resolution (accuracy) for the Milling area , Turning area or Clamping area . For this purpose, the CAD model is subdivided into separate machining areas as required by the collision-checking function. All subareas of the model not inside the milling area, turning area or clamping area are not collision-checked. Inside the milling area\/turning area, you can exclude areas from machining (with the help of stop surfaces , for example). The machining area within the milling area is defined by defining a boundary (possible for all 3D and 5X cycles) or by defining milling surfaces (possible for the following cycles: 3D \/ 5X Profile Finishing, 3D \/ 5X Z Level Finishing, 3D Z Level Shape Finishing and 3D \/ 5X Rest Machining). Machining safety To machine safely with hyper MILL , please observe the following instructions. Traversing movements on the clearance plane are not collision-checked . This applies to all machining processes and cycle calculations as well as to simulation in simulations that are not NC code-based. Therefore the clearance plane must be placed at a sufficient distance above the surface of the component. OPEN MIND recommends the use of an NC code-based simulation such as the VIRTUAL Machining Center or an external simulation program to ensure the greatest possible degree of safety and collision protection.

"body" : "A collision check can either be performed by defining milling areas in the hyper MILL browser or using the hyper MILL Converter (polyhedron model). Model areas located on disabled layers are not converted. You have to create at least one 3DF file (polyhedron model) for each CAD model. Areas with a different accuracy and different stock allowances can be entered in a 3DF file. Several 3DF files are required for CAD models that exceed the travel range of the machine and therefore need to be moved and reclamped during machining. Recommendation: Always convert as many surfaces and solids as possible in one process. The conversion of individual areas with a higher resolution should always include adjacent surfaces. All 3DF files belonging to a model become invalid if the model changes position in the coordinate system, is turned or scaled. Start the converter via the CAM Converter menu. The hyper MILL Converter dialog The hyper MILL Converter dialog consists of the Setup and Options dialog pages. Setup dialog page 3DF file : Select the storage location for the 3DF file. Set the default storage location in the hyperMILL settings dialog. The model name with the *.3df file extension is used as the file name. Resolution Mathematical resolution : Specify the resolution of edge curve circle segments in G1 lengths using the maximum chordal height. Set the surface resolution to be somewhat finer than the dimensional accuracy required in production. Recommendation: roughing 0.5 to 0.1 mm, finishing 0.05 to 0.01 mm, HSC machining 0.005 to 0.001 mm. Max. facet length : Controls the maximum facet length within the 3DF model. Can be defined for each group in group definitions. If a sufficiently precise definition cannot be achieved using the Mathematical resolution function (for example, with surfaces that are only slightly curved), a limit can be set. Selection options All solids, All surfaces, All : Select one of these options if no user-specific selection for conversion is to be used and the selected areas are all to be converted with the same mathematical resolution. User-defined Surfaces : Select solids or surfaces to be converted. The same mathematical resolution applies to all selected surfaces\/solids. Groups Group definition : Select this option if you want to convert areas with different mathematical resolutions and\/or different stock allowances, in order, for example, to define different collision and protected areas. A coarse resolution is sufficient for roughing areas. A finer resolution should be defined for different fine machining processes. The group definition is relevant for: Profile Finishing, Equidistant Finishing, Iso Machining, Free Path Milling. Groups dialog page Groups A 3DF file can contain up to five groups of surfaces and\/or solids with different mathematical resolutions and different stock allowances. A surface can only be allocated to one Surface Group. Current selection Group name : Name of the surface(s). Surfaces : Select the solids or surfaces to be converted. Mathematical resolution : Surface resolution of the model. Allowance : Remaining material on the workpiece. If more than five groups are required to machine a model, create the respective number of 3DF files with different names. You assign the 3DF files in the job definition. Max. facet length : Maximum facet length of the surfaces within a group. Options dialog page Mode of conversion New 3DF file : The selected objects will be converted at the set mathematical resolution and a new 3DF file will be created. Add to existing 3DF file : The selected objects will be converted at the set mathematical resolution and added to the existing 3DF file. In this way, several areas with different mathematical resolutions can be combined into one 3DF file and later modifications to the model can be included. Does not apply to group definitions. Save existing 3DF file Yes : When adding surfaces, the existing 3DF file that the current conversion process is going to expand can be backed up by saving it under a different name. Save as : Select the path and file name for saving the existing 3DF file. No : An existing 3DF file is saved under an existing path and file name with the addition of the new surfaces\/solids to be converted. " },

Display the model in transparent mode Show planes Radius\/surface information Select the surfaces that you want to use for the analysis. Select the frame that you want to use for the analysis. The radius analysis\/plane analysis starts automatically. All radii\/planes found are combined into groups in a list display. Use Max. \/ Min. radius to specify the maximum or minimum size of the radii to be recognized. You use Max.\/Min. angle to specify the maximum or minimum angle of the planes to be recognized. You use the step value to specify the increments for the size of the respective group. If you subsequently change one of these parameters and press RETURN, hyper MILL automatically performs a new calculation that takes account of the modified parameters. Filter You use the Show concave\/convex\/undercut radii options to specify which radii are recognized. In the CAD model, each radius group\/plane group is assigned a color (see List display, column C ) and each group can be individually shown or hidden. To hide a radius group, deselect the check box in column V. To show or hide all groups, right-click in the list display and select All on\/All off . To show or hide all selected groups, right-click in the list display and select All selected on\/All selected off . If you select the relevant line for a radius group or plane group in the list display, all of the radii or planes in this group are colored red in the CAD model. Write planes \/ radii on separate layers You can use this function in the results list shortcut menu to save the radii \/ planes from the analysis on separate layers. If you double-click an entry in the list display, the radii\/surfaces combined and shown in this group are zoomed in (individually) in the graphics window and combined into a special list (Zoom element). You can select the elements in this list individually or you can use the arrow keys to navigate through the list. You can change the color for each radius group or Surface Group in the list display by double-clicking the relevant color symbol in column C. The model appears transparent. In each case, the first transparent color set in the CAD program is used. The model is displayed in the default color for the tool display (also see hyper Mill settings Document colors Tool ). The recognized radii are displayed in the colors for the list display (see also hyper MILL Settings Document Colors Colors for list display ). The model is displayed in the default color for the tool display (also see hyper Mill settings Document Colors Tool ). The recognized planes are displayed in the colors for list display (see also hyper MILL Settings Document Colors Colors for list display ). For the radius analysis and plane analysis , you can save the graphical feedback concerning the displayed parameters in a layer of your choice. For information on this procedure, see Analysing one\/two surfaces. Test tool position You can use the Test tool position function to determine the best frame for a particular type of machining. Setup Click the Tool \/ Frame line to specify the frame and tool . Machine : Specify the machine model to be used for the analysis. Show machine : Enable this function to display the machine model in the graphics window. Configuration Setup point mode : Use Automatic center to place the CAD model automatically at the center of the machine table. Select Manual to specify the setup point for the model. To do this, click the Setup point line and select the required point directly in the graphics window (icon 1) or enter the coordinate values. Click icon 2 to open the Point attribute dialog in order to change the orientation and define an allowance. If you enable the collision check option and define a milling area , the tool is displayed in red if it is in collision. Tool orientation : You can align the tool at the frame that is currently set or at the surface normal. Use the left mouse button to position the tool anywhere in the CAD model. Tool inclination by mouse : You can use the graphical preview of the three axes (A, B and C) to specify (directly at the tool) the tool inclination for each axis separately. To do this, click the relevant preview and use the mouse to move the tool. Then click again when the tool is positioned correctly. Display of position (frame) : Displays the current angles for the B and C axes as well as the coordinates of the tool’s contact point ( X , Y , Z ), based on the frame set under Tool and frame . You can either enter the exact positioning directly in the corresponding line or control the entry using icons. Change tool position based on the displayed coordinate system. Change tool position based on the currently set frame . The accuracy is set using the increment value. Optimize tool length : hyper MILL calculates the optimum tool length for any tool position. Transparent : The model appears transparent. In each case, the first transparent color set in the CAD program is used. Frame : hyper MILL saves the current tool position as a frame. If you use a machine that supports serration, (see Job list ), the frame created is automatically always compatible with the respective serration. Results tool length optimization The Required tool length (including the Tool extension ) as well as the calculated Holder clearance are displayed directly in the dialog. New tool length: Specify how you want to use the tool length optimization results here. The following options are available: Change tool length: The tool used in the job is adjusted accordingly. Please also take into account the effect on other jobs that use the same tool.

Right-click the upper area of the feature browser and select the Feature Mapping (Hole) function from the shortcut menu. The  Feature Mapping (Hole)  dialog comprises the areas  General , Options  and More . General Tolerance : Specifies the accuracy level for transferring the geometric data from the CAD model. Options Check slot : Enable this option if slot recognition is required. Slot tolerance : (1) Enter a distance from which a feature is to be divided into two or more features if the holes are concentric and have the same diameter, but there is free space between them, for example, a slot is constructed. If the distance is smaller, the free space is bridged – only one feature is created. Detect spot depth : Recognized features are checked for spots and any existing spots are displayed accordingly. The spot depth (1) is displayed in the list of feature parameters. Check bottom Recognized features are also checked for bottom spots and any existing spots are displayed accordingly. Gap tolerance : Recognized features are checked for gaps and marked accordingly (see figure). The spot depth (3) is displayed in the list of feature parameters. (1) Gap tolerance < column, (2) Gap tolerance > column . Limiting diameter : Enable this option when holes require diameter limiting. Max. diameter : Features are only created for holes with diameters that are equal to or smaller than the maximum diameter. Use preferred machining direction : All holes that can be machined from the defined direction are combined into a single feature list. Offset angle (degree) : Angle range within which the preferred machining direction is checked. Default = 0.5°. Example : (1) Preferred machining direction is not activated: The machining direction (A) of all holes is unchanged. (2) Preferred machining direction is activated, Offset angle (degree): default (0.5): The machining direction (A) of a hole is reversed. (3) Preferred machining direction is activated, Offset angle (degree): 45°: The machining direction (A) of all holes is reversed. This characteristic is evaluated with application of the feature in an intelligent macro. Check sink : A check is carried out to see if sinks can be machined from the defined direction. In the example, the preferred machining direction is defined using the frame. Example : (1) Check sink is activated. (2) Check sink is not activated. All the features are combined into a feature list and are shown in turquoise. Machining direction (3): Define the machining direction. Click the icon and select a geometric element (line, normal of a surface, frame ...) or enter vectors manually. Feedback position (4): Define the origin of the graphical feedback for the preferred machining direction. Click the icon and select a geometric element (snap point, point ...) or enter coordinate values manually (with reference to the origin of the graphical feedback). More Offset to bottom : Features based on through holes are created with the bottom offset specified here. Use feature list : If this option is enabled, the holes are saved as features in existing feature lists. Feature assignment is in reference to the frames assigned to feature lists. Feature lists that do not contain frames are ignored. Frame creation mode 2D : A feature list is created for each drilling direction and a frame is assigned to each feature list. 5X : All recognized features are combined into one feature list, but a frame is not assigned to this list. Mixed : If several holes have the same orientation, a feature list is created for this orientation and a frame is assigned to the feature list. All other holes are combined into one feature list, but a frame is not assigned to this list. Split by diameter : In the case of multi-step holes, the diameter of the individual steps is taken into account when arranging the features in the feature list (B). The machining direction (4) is included. If, from the direction of machining, the diameter of a subsequent step is greater than the diameter of the preceding step, the hole is divided into two or more Simple (3) and Sink Holes (2). If the split by diameter function is disabled (A), this multi-step hole is included in the feature list as a freely defined hole (1). Check machinability : If this function is enabled (B), only holes that are in accessible areas are recognized as a feature and displayed. In figure (A), the function is disabled; (1) shows the machining direction. Use color table When importing feature information from a CAD model, hyper MILL also recognizes feature properties such as thread, ISO fits or feature classes if these are defined in a color table. hyper MILL evaluates the assignment of color information to feature properties when generating features and incorporates the corresponding parameter directly in the feature. At the same time, this parameter is also included in the feature name and is thus available for selection when creating and using macros. To read information from a color table, activate the option Use color table  in the  Feature Mapping (Hole)  dialog and use the  Edit color table  function (via the menu CAM Setup Settings Database Color table ) to specify colors for threads, ISO-fits and pockets using sample elements. The information is stored in a *.xml file, which is located in the following folder by default. C:\\Users\\Public\\Documents\\OPEN MIND\\ColorTable\\default[version].xml In order for hyper MILL to be able to correctly recognise the Thread and Fits feature properties, they must be defined as follows: Example : <Color_Table>\n \n<Color_Machining_Definition R=\"128\" G=\"64\" B=\"64\" \nFitDesignation=\"H7\" ThreadDesignation=\"Mx\"\nFeatureClass=\"Special FC\" \nUseThreadNominalDiameter=\"1\"\/>\n\n<Color_Machining_Definition R=\"128\" G=\"0\" B=\"128\" \nFitDesignation=\"H12\"ThreadDesignation=\"M;G\"\nUseThreadNominalDiameter=\"0\" \/> \n\n<\/Color_Table> The R (Red), G (Green) and B (Blue) identifiers can be assigned color values between 0 and 255. The FitDesignation element can assume fit designations (example H7 ) and the ThreadDesignation element can assume the values M = Metric Coarse Pitch, Mx = Metric Fine Pitch, W = Whitworth and G = Gas Uni. Several thread types are separated by ; with the order of the list determining the order of the search. The FeatureClass element can accept designations of defined feature classes. UseThreadNominalDiameter can assume the values 0 and 1 . 0 = Reference value is the core diameter of the thread, 1 = Reference value is the nominal diameter of the thread. Use color table only : Only the holes whose color matches the colors in the color table are adopted. Holes with colors, which are not defined in the color table, are not recognized. Use Generic Hole only : During the assignment of feature information from the CAD model, Simple Holes , Sink Holes and Free defined Holes are transferred directly to the feature browser as Generic Holes. Keep CAD features : Activate if a CAD hole feature should remain associatively linked to the hyper MILL feature after feature mapping. This also applies to features that were read in via a direct interface. Min. tip angle : Define from which angle holes can be recognized as a tip or through hole type. If the defined tip angle is larger than the angle in the hole, these holes are recognized as the through hole type. If the tip angle is smaller, the holes are recognized as the tip hole type. Example: (1) Min. tip angle = 75°. Holes 50°\/ 60° = Through, hole 90° = Tip. (2) Min. tip angle = 55°. Holes 50° = Through, holes 60°\/90 = Tip. (3) Min. tip angle = 45°. Holes 50°\/ 60° \/ 90° = Tip Create associative point : Display and edit point coordinates of hole features relative to a selected frame. Grouping features : Features with the same geometry are combined into a feature for each frame. (1) Function is not enabled, (2) Function is enabled. Result of Feature Mapping: All holes that comply with the mapping conditions defined and are drilled in the same direction are compiled into a feature in the feature list. A new frame is created for a feature list if there are at least two holes with the same drilling direction. All of the other features are combined in another feature list without a frame. A hyper MILL feature appears as a new entry in the feature list and can be used in the job definition. Min. segment angle : Cylindrical surfaces with a segment angle greater than 270° are recognized as holes. " },

"body" : "Define the pocket type to be recognized. Select the surfaces of a sample pocket. Define search options and filter criteria. Recognized bottom surfaces and pockets are presented in a list. Option Pocket type : Define a pocket type for recognition purposes. Distinguish between the following: Pocket with bottom : Pockets with a bottom are recognized. T-Slot : T-Slots are recognized. Pockets with bottom and T-slots : Pockets with bottom and T-slot are recognized. Through pocket : Through pockets are recognized. Tolerance : The required tolerance of the curve resolution for the selected feature. Name : Define a name for the pockets. This is used in the hyper MILL feature browser; it also contains the smallest radius in the pocket. This name is used when performing a tool search in the macro database. Example: If a pocket has this name, it can be machined using tools with a radius of 3 mm or less. If you want pockets with bottoms to be recognized, you can use the following options to more accurately specify the sample pockets: Combine pockets : Enable if individual pockets of a model are to be automatically combined into a more complex pocket. When used in a job, combined pockets are processed more efficiently than individual pockets It is possible to combine the following: pockets with bottoms (1), through pockets (2) and open (2) and closed (3) pockets. The pockets must have a common edge (4) and the same frame in order to be combined. Pockets connected to one another through an open pocket (5) are not considered for automatic combination. If the pockets have chamfers or fillets, the values for the corner radius (fillet) or chamfer angle and chamfer height parameters must be identical. It is not possible to join chamfers and fillets for combination. The individually recognized pockets, the combined pockets and the Generic Pocket are displayed in the feature browser as a result of the Pocket Recognition. Generate O-Rings : If this function is activated, the following variants of an O-Ring are recognized: (1) O-Ring with pocket, (2) O-Ring with non-centric hole, (3) O-Ring with centric hole, (4) O-Ring without additional geometry. The following Feature parameters are also recognized: (5) Center, (6) Diameter, (7) Diameter inside, (8) Depth, (9) Hight inside, (10) Inclined angle outside, (11) Inclined angle inside, (12) Hole position, (13) Hole diameter, ( 14) Hole height Suppress chamfers \/ planes : Enable if you want to exclude planes and chamfers from recognition. In this case, the following will be excluded from recognition Planes (pocket bottoms) that do not have any pocket walls and Planes that have been recognized as chamfers (see Setup dialog page). Open pocket reduction : Enable to reduce the number of open pockets that are recognized. If there are several adjacent planes which can potentially be used as bottom surfaces, the largest plane (by area) (1) is used as the pocket bottom. Manually combine pockets Generic Pockets can be manually combined either in the feature browser via the shortcut menu or using the color table. The pockets must have a common edge and the same frame in order to be manually combined. Highlight the pockets to be combined in the feature browser and select the Combine pockets function on the shortcut menu. Use the Setup hyper MILL (dialog page Database ) to open the Color table dialog. Define the colors to be used for the combination in the Pockets section. The color of the hub surface is relevant for pockets with bottoms and the color of the wall surface is relevant for through pockets. Alternatively, click the icon to select a sample element (surface), whose color is to be used. Enable the Use color table option on the Pocket Recognition Setup dialog page and disable the Use all colors option. For pockets that are combined using the Combine pockets shortcut menu in the feature browser, a new feature list is created that is marked with the [ Combined ] notation. Bottom Select all : Searches the entire model for pockets. Surfaces : Select surfaces to be recognized as pocket bottom surfaces. Bottom : Recognized bottom surfaces are presented in a list. Reverse : With closed solids, the correct direction is usually detected automatically. In the case of ambiguous solids or individual surfaces, reverse the direction manually. To do so: Double-click or select the list item. Right-click and select Reverse if the direction of the selected bottom surface is to be reversed or select Reverse all if the direction of all of the bottom surfaces is to be reversed. When the direction of a surface is reversed, pockets that have already been recognized will be removed from the list and Pocket Recognition must be repeated from the beginning. Pocket Recognized pockets are presented in a list. In addition, the parameters Open\/Closed, Height, Edge type (Chamfer\/Fillet), Radius\/Height, Chamfer angle of the respective pocket will be displayed. For each pocket recognized, the functions Close corners and gaps and Close slots are also available in the shortcut menu. Close corners and gaps (A): Boundary contours of pockets (1) whose holes interrupt the contour (2) are closed. Close slots (B): Boundary contours of slot-like pockets that are the same length and run parallel to each other (1) are closed in a semicircle (2). During Pocket Recognition, a check is also automatically carried out to see whether a recognized pocket meets the conditions for a slot. If this is the case and the pocket contour has a start and end point, then the slot profile may be used as a contour during contour milling (example 1) and the slot ends may be used as drill points during drilling (example 2). Example 1: Model (1), Pocket feature (2) and Slot profile as contour (3). Example 2: Model (1), Pocket feature (2) and Slot end as drill points (3). The Pocket features thus created contain the designation Slot in the feature name. Example 3: Generic Pocket <Closed R10 Slot> with Slot profile (1) and Slot width (2). The Slot , Slot profile and Slot width feature parameters are displayed in the feature editor. Proceed as follows to machine the recognized slot: Create a new job (2D Contour Milling) using the corresponding Pocket feature. Define the tool diameter according to the slot width and specify the On contour option as the tool position . Select the Active only option from the shortcut menu of the slot profile on the Feature dialog page. Define all other parameters. " },

Pocket filters Tool diameter : Limit the pocket size using the tool diameter. Only pockets matching the following criteria will be recognized: the upper diameter should not fit in the pocket, while the lower diameter should still fit. Circular pocket limit : This option can be used to prevent holes from being recognized as circular pockets by defining a diameter limitation. Only pockets that fall within the defined limitation are recognized. Chamfer height \/ Fillet radius : Height of the chamfer or radius of the fillet between the bottom surface and the pocket wall. Chamfer angle : Lower \/ upper limit for the chamfer angle between the bottom surface and the pocket wall. Allowed wall types : Specify which wall type is to be recognized. The Perpendicular option corresponds to the Z axis of the frame that is defined on the Pocket example dialog page. Combine pockets : If the Suppress original pockets option is enabled, the original pockets will be deleted after combining. Pocket comparison parameter These two parameters relate to the comparison between the sample pocket and the pockets that are to be recognized (see Comparison dialog page). Scale limit : The minimum \/ maximum scale limit defines the recognition of pockets in the model on the basis of characteristic geometric parameters. Comparison tolerance : The degree of accuracy with which the characteristic geometric parameters (see Scale limit) of one or more sample pocket(s) are compared with the pockets to be recognized. Pocket Recognition can be restricted to certain pockets through the Pocket filter using geometric features. All pocket filters are in effect when the sample pocket is defined. If they are activated, the options under Accessibility check are effective when searching for comparison pockets. Accessibility Since not all pockets are directly accessible and can be processed, conditions for the accessibility of a pocket are defined here. Accessibility check : the accessibility is checked in the direction of the surface normals of the respective bottom surfaces, and in the opposite direction (1). Approach length : defines the minimum distance between a potential bottom plane and another surface that may prevent access to the bottom plane (2). Polyhedron offset : Accessibility of the bottom plane (pocket bottom) is determined on the basis of this contour offset over an extrusion surface. This should always be larger than the value for polyhedron tolerance (3). Polyhedron tolerance : accuracy of the polyhedron representation for the accessibility check (faceting of the model). All recognized pockets are transferred as Generic Pocket feature (close\/open) to a feature list. Pockets with the same Z direction are combined into one list (frame). The colors of the feature lists that you create are defined in the hyper MILL settings (see dialog page Document Colors ). Feature list generation Use feature list : if this option is enabled, the pockets are saved as features in the existing feature lists. Feature assignment is in reference to the frames assigned to feature lists. Feature lists that do not contain frames are ignored. Use color table : When reading feature information, pocket bottoms with a specific color value (RGB value) are automatically recognized and the respective features are assigned to a corresponding feature class. For this purpose, both the color value and the name of the feature class are defined in an XML file. The name and location of the XML file can be selected freely. Example : <Color_Table>\n\n<Color_Machining_Definition\nR=\"214\" G=\"214\" B=\"214\" IsPocketBottom=\"1\" FeatureClass=\"Special\nPocket\"\/>\n\n<\/Color_Table> To read this information, activate the Use color table option, select the corresponding file (format: *.xml ) and confirm your entries. The Pocket feature created contains the designation of the feature class in the feature name. Example : Generische Tasche <Geschlossen R10 Spezial-Feature> . The feature class is displayed in the feature editor (section: General ). Use all colors : Even pocket bottoms whose colors are not contained in the XML file will be recognized. The recognized pockets are, however, not assigned to a feature class. If the function is disabled, only pocket bottoms that correspond to a color in the XML file will be recognized. XML files can also be used in the Feature Mapping area to read in feature information. " },

Higher degree of automation thanks to ‘intelligent’ macros: Using ‘intelligent’ macros, operations that were previously assigned to a feature manually can be automatically linked.

Job parameters : To change job parameters, highlight the required macro job in the bottom window of the database and click Edit or double-click the corresponding list entry. Confirm your changes and close the dialog. Changes do not take effect until you have clicked Save to update the changes in the database. Changes to macros in the database have no effect on macros already applied in the job browser or macro browser. Conversely, editing the applied macros has no effect on the macros stored in the database. Create new macro group To create a new macro group, right-click the left window and select New . Move macro To move a macro to another macro group, right-click the macro you want to move in the right window, select Move to...> and select the macro group to which you want to move the macro. Delete macro group To delete a macro group, right-click the macro group you want to delete in the left window and select Delete . Delete macros To delete a macro, right-click the macro you want to delete in the right window and select Delete . Copy macros To copy a macro, right-click the macro you want to copy in the right window and select Copy . Copy and paste macro jobs Use the Job \/ Copy all jobs to clipboard function on the shortcut menu of the macro job to copy one or all macro jobs from a macro. Use the Paste job \/ Paste all jobs function on the shortcut menu of the macro job to paste the copied job\/jobs into another macro. Link a macro job to a stock model For machining operations with a stock chain (resulting stock), subsequently link a macro job to a stock model if, for example, in a macro the 3D Z Level Shape Finishing macro jobs are used (as here the stock model is not saved when the macro is created) or the 3D Optimized Roughing macro jobs are used and a new job was subsequently programmed. To link a macro job to a stock model, use the following function in the shortcut menu of the previous macro job: Link generated stock to the next job . The Link generated stock to the next job function is only available for jobs that can create resulting stock. Tools in the macro database The Tool data column in the list view indicates how the used tool was created. A distinction is made between the following: Macro : The tool was defined directly in the macro (or job) without a search of the tool database. DB : the tool used for the job is taken from the tool database (numbered NC tool). DB+Auto : Only applies to 2D drilling jobs. Like DB + automatic tool search, the Tool length is taken into account. All of the tools suggested are collision-free. DB+Auto+ : Only applies to 2D drilling jobs. Like DB + automatic tool search, the Tool length and Tool diameter are taken into account. All of the tools suggested are collision-free. Automatic macro search During an automatic macro search, hyper MILL searches the database for macros that match the selected feature and then applies these. Macro optimization Jobs that can be machined using the same tool are processed in sequence (tool change optimization). " },

Intelligent macros also include rules that evaluate geometric information and define when a machining strategy is executed. Intelligent macros are available for all types of features. Initial situation: The workpiece to be machined contains many holes of various depths, diameters and sink types. A typical procedure in production may then be as follows: Using Feature Mapping, the drilling geometries are recognized automatically and saved as a feature. The assignment of the machining methods of these features (jobs) and the saving as a macro are initially done manually. The rules are now defined in the next step.

Specify the parameters you want to free. When you do this, the link between feature parameters and macros is severed so that you can then use the parameters for the purpose of rule definition.

On the Rule dialog tab, click the Job active entry and then click the icon . Set the conditions for enabling a machining mode (of a job) based on simple IF-THEN rules. A part of the macro name is then displayed in square brackets (example: F:D8[Through]). This indicates that parameters have been freed. Feature parameters and formulas can be used to define macro rules. With the aid of formulas, tool parameters (such as T:Rad , T:Len , T:GageLen , T:TipAng ) and user variables (such as F:H , F:R , F:LD ) are available for rule definition. Once you have confirmed your entries, the job will be marked in the macro database with [R] = Rule. Example: [R] Simple Drilling . If all geometries in the model and strategies necessary for machining have been specified as part of the rules and if the corresponding macros have been saved in the macro database, they will be available for cross-model application.

Max. angle increment : Vector density for rapid movements at the clearance distance. Accuracy : Defines the quality of the model (mesh) against which the check takes place. Check hole : Checks the tool for collisions with the model geometry during the drill movement. Check tolerance : Defines the permissible violation of the model geometry; the value must be specified as the radius. Example: with a value of 1, a Ø10 tool can drill a Ø8 hole. Linking movement Define the parameters for the linking movements between the drill holes. Only available for the 5X Drilling drilling mode. Distance angle limit : Angle difference for various tool inclinations between two separate machining areas (for example: drilling groups) of a model. If the defined value (default = 91°) is exceeded or it is equal to the defined value, the linking movement between the two machining areas takes place at the height of the clearance plane, even if Clearance distance is defined as the retract mode (Parameters dialog page) (1). If the angle value falls below the defined value, the linking movement takes place at the height of the clearance distance (dialog page: Parameters) (2). If there is no angle change, the tool moves rapidly to clearance distance. If there is no angle change, the tool moves rapidly to clearance distance. Clearance straighten angle : If the angle between the Z axis of the current machining frame and Z axis of the tool is greater than the defined straighten angle (default = 45°), the tool turns to the defined value for the straighten angle, after it has reached the clearance plane. If the angle between the Z axis of the current machining frame and Z axis of the tool is smaller than or equal to the defined Straighten angle, the tool moves to the clearance plane without changing the tool inclination (3). The clearance straighten angle provides collision avoidance, in particular for machines with conical interpolation that allow a 180° vector change The straighten angle must be defined so that the tip of the tool describes the deepest point of the entire collision body, including spindle and head. The Z axis of the frame must be parallel to the NCS Z axis! Clearance feedrate : Linking movements between two machining areas in the clearance distance are executed at this feedrate. Condition for retraction to clearance plane: Clearance plane is defined as retract mode or value for Clearance straighten angle is exceeded (as described above).

For the new PP technology ( VIRTUAL Machining ), open the Virtual Machine configuration dialog under Machine properties General Virtual Machine directory by clicking the icon and configure the stop of the tool in the NC General Output area with the available options. Max. angle increment : Vector density for rapid movements at the clearance distance. Accuracy : Defines the quality of the model (mesh) against which the check takes place. Check hole : Checks the tool for collisions with the model geometry during the drill movement. Check tolerance : Defines the permissible violation of the model geometry; the value must be specified as the radius. Example: with a value of 1, a Ø10 tool can drill a Ø8 hole. Linking movement Define the parameters for the linking movements between the drill holes. Only available for the 5X Drilling drilling mode. Distance angle limit : Angle difference for various tool inclinations between two separate machining areas (for example: drilling groups) of a model. If the defined value (default = 91°) is exceeded or it is equal to the defined value, the linking movement between the two machining areas takes place at the height of the clearance plane, even if Clearance distance is defined as the retract mode (Parameters dialog page) (1). If the angle value falls below the defined value, the linking movement takes place at the height of the clearance distance (dialog page: Parameters) (2). If there is no angle change, the tool moves rapidly to clearance distance. If there is no angle change, the tool moves rapidly to clearance distance. Clearance straighten angle : If the angle between the Z axis of the current machining frame and Z axis of the tool is greater than the defined straighten angle (default = 45°), the tool turns to the defined value for the straighten angle, after it has reached the clearance plane. If the angle between the Z axis of the current machining frame and Z axis of the tool is smaller than or equal to the defined Straighten angle, the tool moves to the clearance plane without changing the tool inclination (3). The clearance straighten angle provides collision avoidance, in particular for machines with conical interpolation that allow a 180° vector change The straighten angle must be defined so that the tip of the tool describes the deepest point of the entire collision body, including spindle and head. The Z axis of the frame must be parallel to the NCS Z axis! Clearance feedrate : Linking movements between two machining areas in the clearance distance are executed at this feedrate. Condition for retraction to clearance plane: Clearance plane is defined as retract mode or value for Clearance straighten angle is exceeded (as described above).

Additional surfaces: Temporary safety surfaces to avoid unnecessary rapid travel movements. For information on the holder\/spindle clearance, see section Check tool . NC parameters Stop before execution : A stop marker in the toolpath causes the tool to stop. In addition to activating this function, go to the Machine properties Program halt dialog and enter the command to stop the tool (by means of M function or command chain). Open the Machine properties dialog via Job list Postprocessor Machine Machine administration Edit . For the new PP technology ( VIRTUAL Machining ), open the Virtual Machine configuration dialog under Machine properties General Virtual Machine directory by clicking the icon and configure the stop of the tool in the NC General Output area with the available options. Max. angle increment : Vector density for rapid movements at the clearance distance. Accuracy : Defines the quality of the model (mesh) against which the check takes place. Check hole : Checks the tool for collisions with the model geometry during the drill movement. Check tolerance : Defines the permissible violation of the model geometry; the value must be specified as the radius. Example: with a value of 1, a Ø10 tool can drill a Ø8 hole. Linking movement Define the parameters for the linking movements between the drill holes. Only available for the 5X Drilling drilling mode. Distance angle limit : Angle difference for various tool inclinations between two separate machining areas (for example: drilling groups) of a model. If the defined value (default = 91°) is exceeded or it is equal to the defined value, the linking movement between the two machining areas takes place at the height of the clearance plane, even if Clearance distance is defined as the retract mode (Parameters dialog page) (1). If the angle value falls below the defined value, the linking movement takes place at the height of the clearance distance (dialog page: Parameters) (2). If there is no angle change, the tool moves rapidly to clearance distance. If there is no angle change, the tool moves rapidly to clearance distance. Clearance straighten angle : If the angle between the Z axis of the current machining frame and Z axis of the tool is greater than the defined straighten angle (default = 45°), the tool turns to the defined value for the straighten angle, after it has reached the clearance plane. If the angle between the Z axis of the current machining frame and Z axis of the tool is smaller than or equal to the defined Straighten angle, the tool moves to the clearance plane without changing the tool inclination (3). The clearance straighten angle provides collision avoidance, in particular for machines with conical interpolation that allow a 180° vector change The straighten angle must be defined so that the tip of the tool describes the deepest point of the entire collision body, including spindle and head. The Z axis of the frame must be parallel to the NCS Z axis! Clearance feedrate : Linking movements between two machining areas in the clearance distance are executed at this feedrate. Condition for retraction to clearance plane: Clearance plane is defined as retract mode or value for Clearance straighten angle is exceeded (as described above). Stock To recognize breakthroughs and\/or crossholes, you need to define a stock model within the Optimized deep Hole Drilling cycle. " },

For the new PP technology ( VIRTUAL Machining ), open the Virtual Machine configuration dialog under Machine properties General Virtual Machine directory by clicking the icon and configure the stop of the tool in the NC General Output area with the available options. Max. angle increment : Vector density for rapid movements at the clearance distance. Accuracy : Defines the quality of the model (mesh) against which the check takes place. Check hole : Checks the tool for collisions with the model geometry during the drill movement. Check tolerance : Defines the permissible violation of the model geometry; the value must be specified as the radius. Example: with a value of 1, a Ø10 tool can drill a Ø8 hole. Linking movement Define the parameters for the linking movements between the drill holes. Only available for the 5X Drilling drilling mode. Distance angle limit : Angle difference for various tool inclinations between two separate machining areas (for example: drilling groups) of a model. If the defined value (default = 91°) is exceeded or it is equal to the defined value, the linking movement between the two machining areas takes place at the height of the clearance plane, even if Clearance distance is defined as the retract mode (Parameters dialog page) (1). If the angle value falls below the defined value, the linking movement takes place at the height of the clearance distance (dialog page: Parameters) (2). If there is no angle change, the tool moves rapidly to clearance distance. If there is no angle change, the tool moves rapidly to clearance distance. Clearance straighten angle : If the angle between the Z axis of the current machining frame and Z axis of the tool is greater than the defined straighten angle (default = 45°), the tool turns to the defined value for the straighten angle, after it has reached the clearance plane. If the angle between the Z axis of the current machining frame and Z axis of the tool is smaller than or equal to the defined Straighten angle, the tool moves to the clearance plane without changing the tool inclination (3). The clearance straighten angle provides collision avoidance, in particular for machines with conical interpolation that allow a 180° vector change The straighten angle must be defined so that the tip of the tool describes the deepest point of the entire collision body, including spindle and head. The Z axis of the frame must be parallel to the NCS Z axis! Clearance feedrate : Linking movements between two machining areas in the clearance distance are executed at this feedrate. Condition for retraction to clearance plane: Clearance plane is defined as retract mode or value for Clearance straighten angle is exceeded (as described above).

Clearance straighten angle : If the angle between the Z axis of the current machining frame and Z axis of the tool is greater than the defined straighten angle (default = 45°), the tool turns to the defined value for the straighten angle, after it has reached the clearance plane. If the angle between the Z axis of the current machining frame and Z axis of the tool is smaller than or equal to the defined Straighten angle, the tool moves to the clearance plane without changing the tool inclination (3). The clearance straighten angle provides collision avoidance, in particular for machines with conical interpolation that allow a 180° vector change The straighten angle must be defined so that the tip of the tool describes the deepest point of the entire collision body, including spindle and head. The Z axis of the frame must be parallel to the NCS Z axis! Clearance feedrate : Linking movements between two machining areas in the clearance distance are executed at this feedrate.

For the new PP technology ( VIRTUAL Machining ), open the Virtual Machine configuration dialog under Machine properties General Virtual Machine directory by clicking the icon and configure the stop of the tool in the NC General Output area with the available options. Max. angle increment : Vector density for rapid movements at the clearance distance. Accuracy : Defines the quality of the model (mesh) against which the check takes place. Check hole : Checks the tool for collisions with the model geometry during the drill movement. Check tolerance : Defines the permissible violation of the model geometry; the value must be specified as the radius. Example: with a value of 1, a Ø10 tool can drill a Ø8 hole. Linking movement Define the parameters for the linking movements between the drill holes. Only available for the 5X Drilling drilling mode. Distance angle limit : Angle difference for various tool inclinations between two separate machining areas (for example: drilling groups) of a model. If the defined value (default = 91°) is exceeded or it is equal to the defined value, the linking movement between the two machining areas takes place at the height of the clearance plane, even if Clearance distance is defined as the retract mode (Parameters dialog page) (1). If the angle value falls below the defined value, the linking movement takes place at the height of the clearance distance (dialog page: Parameters) (2). If there is no angle change, the tool moves rapidly to clearance distance. If there is no angle change, the tool moves rapidly to clearance distance. Clearance straighten angle : If the angle between the Z axis of the current machining frame and Z axis of the tool is greater than the defined straighten angle (default = 45°), the tool turns to the defined value for the straighten angle, after it has reached the clearance plane. If the angle between the Z axis of the current machining frame and Z axis of the tool is smaller than or equal to the defined Straighten angle, the tool moves to the clearance plane without changing the tool inclination (3). The clearance straighten angle provides collision avoidance, in particular for machines with conical interpolation that allow a 180° vector change The straighten angle must be defined so that the tip of the tool describes the deepest point of the entire collision body, including spindle and head. The Z axis of the frame must be parallel to the NCS Z axis! Clearance feedrate : Linking movements between two machining areas in the clearance distance are executed at this feedrate. Condition for retraction to clearance plane: Clearance plane is defined as retract mode or value for Clearance straighten angle is exceeded (as described above).

If the angle between the Z axis of the current machining frame and Z axis of the tool is smaller than or equal to the defined Straighten angle, the tool moves to the clearance plane without changing the tool inclination (3). The clearance straighten angle provides collision avoidance, in particular for machines with conical interpolation that allow a 180° vector change The straighten angle must be defined so that the tip of the tool describes the deepest point of the entire collision body, including spindle and head. The Z axis of the frame must be parallel to the NCS Z axis! Clearance feedrate : Linking movements between two machining areas in the clearance distance are executed at this feedrate. Condition for retraction to clearance plane: Clearance plane is defined as retract mode or value for Clearance straighten angle is exceeded (as described above). Stock To recognize breakthroughs and\/or crossholes, you need to define a stock model within the Optimized deep Hole Drilling cycle. " },

In addition to activating this function, go to the Machine properties Program halt dialog and enter the command to stop the tool (by means of M function or command chain). Open the Machine properties dialog via Job list Postprocessor Machine Machine administration Edit . For the new PP technology ( VIRTUAL Machining ), open the Virtual Machine configuration dialog under Machine properties General Virtual Machine directory by clicking the icon and configure the stop of the tool in the NC General Output area with the available options. Max. angle increment : Vector density for rapid movements at the clearance distance. Accuracy : Defines the quality of the model (mesh) against which the check takes place. Check hole : Checks the tool for collisions with the model geometry during the drill movement. Check tolerance : Defines the permissible violation of the model geometry; the value must be specified as the radius. Example: with a value of 1, a Ø10 tool can drill a Ø8 hole. Linking movement Define the parameters for the linking movements between the drill holes. Only available for the 5X Drilling drilling mode. Distance angle limit : Angle difference for various tool inclinations between two separate machining areas (for example: drilling groups) of a model. If the defined value (default = 91°) is exceeded or it is equal to the defined value, the linking movement between the two machining areas takes place at the height of the clearance plane, even if Clearance distance is defined as the retract mode (Parameters dialog page) (1). If the angle value falls below the defined value, the linking movement takes place at the height of the clearance distance (dialog page: Parameters) (2). If there is no angle change, the tool moves rapidly to clearance distance. If there is no angle change, the tool moves rapidly to clearance distance. Clearance straighten angle : If the angle between the Z axis of the current machining frame and Z axis of the tool is greater than the defined straighten angle (default = 45°), the tool turns to the defined value for the straighten angle, after it has reached the clearance plane. If the angle between the Z axis of the current machining frame and Z axis of the tool is smaller than or equal to the defined Straighten angle, the tool moves to the clearance plane without changing the tool inclination (3). The clearance straighten angle provides collision avoidance, in particular for machines with conical interpolation that allow a 180° vector change The straighten angle must be defined so that the tip of the tool describes the deepest point of the entire collision body, including spindle and head. The Z axis of the frame must be parallel to the NCS Z axis! Clearance feedrate : Linking movements between two machining areas in the clearance distance are executed at this feedrate. Condition for retraction to clearance plane: Clearance plane is defined as retract mode or value for Clearance straighten angle is exceeded (as described above).

Check hole : Checks the tool for collisions with the model geometry during the drill movement. Check tolerance : Defines the permissible violation of the model geometry; the value must be specified as the radius. Example: with a value of 1, a Ø10 tool can drill a Ø8 hole. Linking movement Define the parameters for the linking movements between the drill holes. Only available for the 5X Drilling drilling mode. Distance angle limit : Angle difference for various tool inclinations between two separate machining areas (for example: drilling groups) of a model. If the defined value (default = 91°) is exceeded or it is equal to the defined value, the linking movement between the two machining areas takes place at the height of the clearance plane, even if Clearance distance is defined as the retract mode (Parameters dialog page) (1). If the angle value falls below the defined value, the linking movement takes place at the height of the clearance distance (dialog page: Parameters) (2). If there is no angle change, the tool moves rapidly to clearance distance. If there is no angle change, the tool moves rapidly to clearance distance. Clearance straighten angle : If the angle between the Z axis of the current machining frame and Z axis of the tool is greater than the defined straighten angle (default = 45°), the tool turns to the defined value for the straighten angle, after it has reached the clearance plane. If the angle between the Z axis of the current machining frame and Z axis of the tool is smaller than or equal to the defined Straighten angle, the tool moves to the clearance plane without changing the tool inclination (3). The clearance straighten angle provides collision avoidance, in particular for machines with conical interpolation that allow a 180° vector change The straighten angle must be defined so that the tip of the tool describes the deepest point of the entire collision body, including spindle and head. The Z axis of the frame must be parallel to the NCS Z axis! Clearance feedrate : Linking movements between two machining areas in the clearance distance are executed at this feedrate. Condition for retraction to clearance plane: Clearance plane is defined as retract mode or value for Clearance straighten angle is exceeded (as described above).

Max. angle increment : Vector density for rapid movements at the clearance distance. Accuracy : Defines the quality of the model (mesh) against which the check takes place. Check hole : Checks the tool for collisions with the model geometry during the drill movement. Check tolerance : Defines the permissible violation of the model geometry; the value must be specified as the radius. Example: with a value of 1, a Ø10 tool can drill a Ø8 hole. Linking movement Define the parameters for the linking movements between the drill holes. Only available for the 5X Drilling drilling mode. Distance angle limit : Angle difference for various tool inclinations between two separate machining areas (for example: drilling groups) of a model. If the defined value (default = 91°) is exceeded or it is equal to the defined value, the linking movement between the two machining areas takes place at the height of the clearance plane, even if Clearance distance is defined as the retract mode (Parameters dialog page) (1). If the angle value falls below the defined value, the linking movement takes place at the height of the clearance distance (dialog page: Parameters) (2). If there is no angle change, the tool moves rapidly to clearance distance. If there is no angle change, the tool moves rapidly to clearance distance. Clearance straighten angle : If the angle between the Z axis of the current machining frame and Z axis of the tool is greater than the defined straighten angle (default = 45°), the tool turns to the defined value for the straighten angle, after it has reached the clearance plane. If the angle between the Z axis of the current machining frame and Z axis of the tool is smaller than or equal to the defined Straighten angle, the tool moves to the clearance plane without changing the tool inclination (3). The clearance straighten angle provides collision avoidance, in particular for machines with conical interpolation that allow a 180° vector change The straighten angle must be defined so that the tip of the tool describes the deepest point of the entire collision body, including spindle and head. The Z axis of the frame must be parallel to the NCS Z axis! Clearance feedrate : Linking movements between two machining areas in the clearance distance are executed at this feedrate. Condition for retraction to clearance plane: Clearance plane is defined as retract mode or value for Clearance straighten angle is exceeded (as described above).

"body" : "Drilling point optimization allows any drilling patterns to be optimized in accordance with various criteria (not available for the Turning strategy), so that the stresses and heat that are generated during drilling are distributed as evenly as possible over the entire surface. hyper MILL generates a graphical feedback of the drilling points that have been selected for machining. Since a large number of drilling points requires a correspondingly powerful computer to calculate and display this graphical preview, the preview display is limited to 1000 drilling points by default. Sorting strategy Off : Drill holes are machined in the order in which they were selected. Shortest distance : Machining is carried out starting with the (drilling) point closest to the origin of the specified coordinate system (frame), followed by the next closest in each case. Select the Use start reference option to use a start point as the reference for the beginning of the optimization. Circular : The drill holes to be machined are divided into concentric circle segments starting from a center point. X or Y parallel : The drill holes to be machined are divided into segments that are referenced on the X or Y axis of the selected machining coordinate system (frame). Contour parallel : The drill holes are machined along the outline of the outer contour of the drilling point pattern. More information about the various parameters is provided in the next few chapters. Frame dependent : Available for the 5X Helical Drilling cycle. The direction of the drill holes is aligned with the Z axis of the defined frame system. When using features, the frame system is part of the feature definition.

Distance angle limit : Angle difference for various tool inclinations between two separate machining areas (for example: drilling groups) of a model. If the defined value (default = 91°) is exceeded or it is equal to the defined value, the linking movement between the two machining areas takes place at the height of the clearance plane, even if Clearance distance is defined as the retract mode (Parameters dialog page) (1). If the angle value falls below the defined value, the linking movement takes place at the height of the clearance distance (dialog page: Parameters) (2). If there is no angle change, the tool moves rapidly to clearance distance. If there is no angle change, the tool moves rapidly to clearance distance. Clearance straighten angle : If the angle between the Z axis of the current machining frame and Z axis of the tool is greater than the defined straighten angle (default = 45°), the tool turns to the defined value for the straighten angle, after it has reached the clearance plane. If the angle between the Z axis of the current machining frame and Z axis of the tool is smaller than or equal to the defined Straighten angle, the tool moves to the clearance plane without changing the tool inclination (3). The clearance straighten angle provides collision avoidance, in particular for machines with conical interpolation that allow a 180° vector change The straighten angle must be defined so that the tip of the tool describes the deepest point of the entire collision body, including spindle and head. The Z axis of the frame must be parallel to the NCS Z axis! Clearance feedrate : Linking movements between two machining areas in the clearance distance are executed at this feedrate. Condition for retraction to clearance plane: Clearance plane is defined as retract mode or value for Clearance straighten angle is exceeded (as described above).

The values for the Additional allowance for contours are taken into account for the path generation but not for collision checks for rapid link movements. The Allowance values defined on the Parameters dialog page are used for this. Reverse : In the default setting the machining direction follows the direction of the selected contour. This can be seen in the graphic preview. If the generated toolpaths do not result in the intended machining direction, select the relevant contours and select the Reverse option.

Zigzag : enable function when machining with alternating orientation should be enabled. Two different strategies are available in High Performance Mode: Opening cut and Side mill only . The following applies to both strategies: The toolpaths created with hyper MILL are optimized in terms of the minimum machining time at maximum removal rate, taking into account dynamic feedrate values for different machining situations. The Fillet radius parameter must be at least 5% of the tool diameter. Opening cut (1): If this option is enabled, narrow, inaccessible areas (A) with several vertical stepdowns (full cut) can be opened. A trochoidal strategy may be used. hyper MILL determines the most suitable strategy for the particular machining situation internally in terms of the shortest overall machining time. Side mill only (2): If this option is enabled, no full cut behavior is allowed. Narrow, inaccessible areas (A) are opened with trochoidal movements. Reposition For both strategies (Opening cut and Side mill only) the following applies: Safety (1): axial movement (in the Z direction) away from the plane currently being machined. Default value: Clearance distance * 0.1. Feedrate : Value for the maximum achievable Feedrate for all movements to reposition the tool without material removal. Infeed Dense area stepover (factor) (1): The value is multiplied by the Stepover (factor of diameter) (see Parameters dialog page) and defines the lateral infeed for trochoidal movements in narrow, inaccessible areas. A reduction in the horizontal stepover in narrow areas may be particularly useful for hard materials. Plunge feedrate : Feedrate for plunge movement ( macros ) in pockets that cannot be accessed from outside (closed pockets). Min . Enable feedrate to specify a minimum value for the plunge feedrate. Opening cut For the opening cut, both the vertical stepdown and the feedrate can be adjusted to the particular machining situation. Vertical stepdown (1): The number of stepovers (vertical stepdown) is calculated from the total infeed defined. Example: If the total infeed is 2 and the vertical stepdown for the opening cut is 0.5, machining occurs in 4 infeeds. Feedrate : value for the maximum achievable feedrate for the opening cut. Enable min. feedrate to specify a minimum value for the opening cut feedrate. A change in the feedrate for the opening cut may change the machining strategy for narrow areas (trochoidal > full cut). hyper MILL determines the most suitable strategy internally in terms of the shortest overall machining time, taking into account the feedrate value. Entry feedrate A targeted feedrate adjustment at the moment of entry into the material can be especially useful with hard workpiece materials. Factor side entry regulates the lateral approach (not when the position is tangential to the contour) from outside and is referenced to the feedrate XY of the tool. Factor plunge entry affects the helical or ramp plunge into the material from above. This factor is calculated with plunge feedrate. Zigzag feedrate Feedrate : Factor that influences the feedrate of the opposite direction. If climb milling is chosen as cutting mode, the opposite direction feedrate, i.e., the conventional milling feedrate, is reduced by the specified factor. The 0.8 factor equates to a feedrate reduction of 20%. The following restrictions apply in High Performance Mode : Dialog page Tool Corner fillet radius must be greater than 0.05* tool diameter. In the case of tools with a core, the core diameter must be smaller than 0.9* tool diameter, and smaller than the flat part of the tool. Ball endmills with core are not permitted. For bullnose end mills , the following applies: core diameter *0.5 must be smaller than the radius - corner radius. Dialog page Strategy Plunge points are not supported. The Use adaptive pocket option is not available. No G2\/G3 movements can be generated in the 3D Mode . Dialog page Parameters Fillet all toolpaths is enabled by default. The Radius for horizontal infeed parameter is not available. The negative stock allowance XY must not be greater than 0.25 * tool diameter in the 2D mode \/ Stock mode . The conditions that govern the 3D Mode depend on the tool type: Endmill : no negative XY allowance allowed. If (stock allowance XY - stock allowance Z) < 0, the absolute value of this difference must be smaller than the tool radius. Ball endmill : Absolute value of the negative stock allowance XY < tool radius. Stock allowance XY must be greater than stock allowance Z. Bullnose endmill : negative stock allowance is only permitted up to the absolute value <= corner radius. If (stock allowance XY - stock allowance Z) < 0, the absolute value of this difference must be smaller than (radius - corner radius) of the tool. The retract mode is set to retraction plane.

Allowance For information on Allowance XY and Allowance Z see section Allowance . Please note that the values for Stock allowance XY and Allowance (lateral Infeed area) add up for 2D Contour Milling. Lateral infeed area Stepover (factor of diameter) : Stepover in the XY plane as a factor of the cutter diameter. Offset : For pre-machined contours with constant offset, this can be removed parallel to the contour in several horizontal stepovers. Usage: Rework-machining premachined contours whose stock allowance cannot be cleared with one horizontal stepover Clearing open pockets Machining sequence Bottom (A): Each contour is fully processed in accordance with the defined vertical stepdown, and while taking account of the top and bottom (1). The system then switches to the next contour (2). Plane (B): In every plane, the offset will be completely removed in multiple horizontal stepovers (1), followed by switching to the next contour (2). Interior corners Fillet interior corners : Smooth filleting (rounding) of internal milling paths for contour pockets or islands. Interior corners are machined at the reduced feedrate. Reduce corner feedrate : Corner machining at reduced feedrate. Also available for Contour Milling on 3D Model . The feedrate reduction depends on the profile of the toolpath generated. A reduction occurs when the angle between the current and changed direction is greater than \/ equal to 60° in sharp corners. The reduction begins with a value of 0.5 * tool radius before the corner. Example: (1) Tool D10, Angle < 60° - Machining at normal feedrate (2) Tool D18, Angle > 60° - Machining at reduced feedrate Only available for the path compensations Center path and Compensated center path. Options End with plunge point : Enable if a plunge point for machining was defined and machining should also finish at the defined plunge point. Note that the starting point of the contour may not lie on an outer corner. Normally, machining is completed in a downward motion - from the top parameter (1) to the bottom parameter (2), see (A). Bottom to top milling : Machining is completed in an upward motion from the bottom parameter (2) to the top parameter (1), see (B). The stepdown always takes place via the clearance distance in a spiral. Prefer spiral : If possible, a spiral tool path is created. Rapid plunge : If the function is activated, the first infeed is made in rapid. Example : (1) Top , (2) Bottom , (3) Bottom to top milling and Prefer spiral are activated. Plunging takes place as a G1 movement. (4) Bottom to top milling , Prefer spiral and Rapid plunge are activated. Plunging takes place as a G0 movement.

Use the Length , Height and Radius options to control the length, height and radius of the approach and retract movement, allowing the tool to plunge gently into the material. Machining marks in adjacent planes are avoided. Example : (A) Approach macro = tangential, (B) Approach macro = quarter circle, (1) Height, (2) Length, (3) Radius. Macro extension : Only available for quarter circle. The macro is extended by the specified value. This guarantees that the tool can fully retract from the groove without leaving behind any material (such as chippings\/shavings).This is particularly important for Bottom to top milling (see Parameters section). Contour extension (open contours only) Click Start to extend the contour (of the toolpath) by the specified amount for the approach movement. Click End to extend the contour (of the toolpath) by the specified amount for the retract movement. Macro position Left \/ Right : The macro movement takes place to the left or right of the tool, from the perspective of the contour. Only available in manual macro mode. For the Auto climb tool position, the Left and Right parameters are not available. For the On contour tool position, either Left or Right can be defined as the macro position. For the Left tool position, the Left macro position is activated as standard (and cannot be changed). For the Right tool position, the Right macro position is activated as standard (and cannot be changed). Feedrate macros The feedrate may be defined for both Approach and Retract . " },

The contour list on the dialog page shows further parameters such as Start, End and Plunge. Top and bottom contours of selected 3D contours are projected into the corresponding planes from the point of view of the current frame (4). Please observe: Relative = 0: Upper edge of the selected geometry (5). Thickness = 0: Bottom edge of the selected geometry (6). Top : Start of machining in Z direction (1). Bottom : End depth of machining in Z direction (2). Both parameters are relative to the current frame. It is possible to have various vertical machining areas for the different machining contours in a job. By making multiple selections, the same top and bottom definitions can be applied simultaneously to different contours. Both parameters can be defined as absolute and relative values, and as Thickness. Thus top and bottom definitions can be made with various measurements. Absolute (jobframe) (A): The values you set are relative to the current frame. Use the absolute dimensions when a drawing has no defined Z coordinates (2D drawing). In these cases, define the top (1) as absolute and the bottom as relative or as absolute depending on the dimensions in the drawing (3). Selected contour (2) Specifying relative dimensions (B): Relative values are relative to the position of the CAD geometry selected in the model. This way of specifying top (1) and\/or bottom (3) should be used for drawings that have Z information (for example, 3D contours, solids, defined thicknesses). Here, (2) stands for Z = 0 as the upper edge of the geometry. Working with thickness (C): Thicknesses are relative to the position of the CAD geometry selected in the model. This way of specifying top (1) and\/or bottom (2) should be used for drawings that have Z information (for example, 3D contours, solids, defined thicknesses). Select the Preferred start point , End point or Plunge point checkbox and select a point. Freely select the start point (1) for each contour.

The cutter moves directly from the plunge point to the starting point or to the approach macro position. The plunge point is not collision checked. Reverse : In the default setting the machining direction follows the direction of the selected contour. This can be seen in the graphic preview. If the generated toolpaths do not result in the intended machining direction, select the relevant contours and select the Reverse option. If you change the machining direction, you should change the cutter position as well. Overlap : An overlap is only permissible for closed contours. The toolpath will move the tool past the start point (1) until it reaches the given end point (2). Optimization Optimize start points : For closed contours, a search is automatically performed to find the best start points that will facilitate a collision-free standard macro. If a manual start point is defined, this is the preferred start point. Otherwise, either the outer edges (1) or the center point of the longest contour element (2) is used as a start point. " },

The contour list on the dialog page shows further parameters such as Start, End and Plunge. Top and bottom contours of selected 3D contours are projected into the corresponding planes from the point of view of the current frame (4). Please observe: Relative = 0: Upper edge of the selected geometry (5). Thickness = 0: Bottom edge of the selected geometry (6). Top : Start of machining in Z direction (1). Bottom : End depth of machining in Z direction (2). Both parameters are relative to the current frame. It is possible to have various vertical machining areas for the different machining contours in a job. By making multiple selections, the same top and bottom definitions can be applied simultaneously to different contours. Both parameters can be defined as absolute and relative values, and as Thickness. Thus top and bottom definitions can be made with various measurements. Absolute (jobframe) (A): The values you set are relative to the current frame. Use the absolute dimensions when a drawing has no defined Z coordinates (2D drawing). In these cases, define the top (1) as absolute and the bottom as relative or as absolute depending on the dimensions in the drawing (3). Selected contour (2) Specifying relative dimensions (B): Relative values are relative to the position of the CAD geometry selected in the model. This way of specifying top (1) and\/or bottom (3) should be used for drawings that have Z information (for example, 3D contours, solids, defined thicknesses). Here, (2) stands for Z = 0 as the upper edge of the geometry. Working with thickness (C): Thicknesses are relative to the position of the CAD geometry selected in the model. This way of specifying top (1) and\/or bottom (2) should be used for drawings that have Z information (for example, 3D contours, solids, defined thicknesses). Freely select the start point (1) for each contour. Set an end point (2) if the contour is to be machined only partially or if there should be an overlap. Plunge point : The plunge point (1) applies for the infeed to the first workplane. The cutter moves directly from the plunge point to the starting point or to the approach macro position. The plunge point is not collision checked. Reverse : In the default setting the machining direction follows the direction of the selected contour. This can be seen in the graphic preview. If the generated toolpaths do not result in the intended machining direction, select the relevant contours and select the Reverse option. Align closed contours : The machining direction can be reversed for all selected closed (!) contours simultaneously. To do so, select the contours and specify the direction of the contours using the Align closed contours Clockwise \/ Counterclockwise function from the shortcut menu. The start point and end point are interchanged automatically. If you change the machining direction, you should change the cutter position as well. Overlap : An overlap is only permissible for closed contours. The toolpath will move the tool past the start point (1) until it reaches the given end point (2). " },

Profile Finishing : Allows multi-surface, collision-free milling with different guide curve strategies; optional slope-dependent machining. XY optimized machining is offered for the X axis and Y axis machining profiles. Z Level Finishing : Z constant finishing with optional slope-dependent machining. By adapting the vertical stepdown values to the surface flow especially for steep surfaces, unnecessary fine infeed increments are avoided and an optimal line distance is thus guaranteed. Z Level Shape Finishing : Z-Level machining for steep areas. Optionally, plane machining can be replaced by cuts parallel to any shape. Iso Machining : The milling paths follow the ISO lines (U, V) so that the toolpaths are optimally adapted to the surface curve. Free Path Milling : Milling of freely defined 3D contours. Multiple vertical stepdown and ramped transition between milling paths are possible. Plane Machining : Face Milling of planar surfaces with pocket strategy. Automatic plane level detection or manual selection of surfaces. The stockmodel can be used for trimming. Complete Finishing : Z constant finishing with automatic pocket-shaped machining of flat areas. Equidistant Finishing : Finishing with constant infeed on surface; particularly suitable for high-speed milling. Machining takes place equidistantly within a closed guide curve or flowing between two guide curves. Form Pocket : Finishing of pockets with free-form floor. Automatic Rest Machining : Targeted rework machining of individual rest material areas left during a finishing cycle. Corner Rest Machining: Optimized removal of rest material in vertical corners and adjacent bottom surfaces within pocket and pocket-like geometries with constant corner radii. Cutting Edge : Optimized machining of cutting edges using curve-based pre-roughing (strategy: manual curve) in 3D mode, followed by rest machining in 2D mode (strategy: reference cycle). Pencil Milling : Automatic detection and machining of grooves. Rework Machining : Machining of pre-calculated toolpaths from a reference job where the toolpaths could not be machined due to detected collisions. For the rework machining, a different tool is applied to avoid the previously detected collision areas from the reference job.

"body" : "Vertical stepdown (1): The vertical stepdown determines the number of machining planes. Allowance (2): remaining material on the workpiece. Calculated in direction of the surface normals. Added to the Clearance parameter during machining (see section Check tool). For the 3D Arbitrary Stock Roughing cycle, the distance between the tool and the stock and model is specified by the defined clearance only. If the XY allowance is negative, end mills are not allowed. If a bullnose end mill is used, the negative XY allowance must be smaller or equal to the tool radius minus the corner radius. Example : tool radius (5 mm) - corner radius (4 mm) = 1 mm. The stock allowance only applies for surfaces. For areas where there are no surfaces present there will be no stock allowance calculated. Z constant machining: In the last machining level, the allowance only applies in X and Y direction, not in Z direction. The specification of negative stock allowances is possible as long as the sum of (negative) stock allowance and tool corner radius does not become negative. When specifying negative stock allowances, surface gaps should not exceed the following maximum values (otherwise, risk of ‘nose-diving’): 2 x (tool radius + negative allowance). Additional allowance XY : Additional horizontal stock allowance enables machining with different stock allowances for the bottom and side walls of the machining area. Limitations : If the sum of the allowances is negative, the total amount must be less than the tool radius - machining tolerance. Example : tool radius = 5.00 mm, machining tolerance = 0.01 mm, allowance = -3.0 mm. Additional allowance XY must be greater than -1.99 mm, e.g. - 1.98, for |-3.00mm +(-1.98mm)| < 5.00mm -0.01mm.

Subdivision into the machining areas Efficient machining with short machining times and minimized rework machining can often only be carried out if the component has been subdivided carefully into different machining areas (particular surfaces, group of surfaces). Geometric criteria: surface curvature, main direction, characteristic extension, position in space of the surface Suitable tool type Optimum milling strategy. Independent machining areas with the same machining direction, same machining strategy and the same tool with the same orientation of the frame can be machined together in one cycle. In order to avoid steps and tool marks, the machining areas should not overlap and should not be too close together. If this is not possible, the boundaries should be combined into one machining area. To avoid unwanted nose-diving of the tool, the boundary area and the edges of the milling surfaces must not contain any surfaces the tool cannot access (slots, for example). Milling surfaces must not contain any double or superimposed surfaces. Areas within a boundary, for example in the case of problems with the milling strategy, can be excluded from machining. Define machining area Define the machining area either using Boundary curve \/ Curve selection (1) or Milling surfaces \/ Surface selection (2). If no machining area has been defined, the limitations of the component, including an offset are regarded as the machining boundaries. To machine stock that has not been pre-formed, always define the stock boundaries as the machining area in order to avoid empty cuts due to an internal offset. Surfaces that are not visible (1) from the ‘perspective’ of the tool axis (Z axis of the frame system) are excluded from machining. " },

With the Adaptive Pocket strategy, the geometry of rectangular and circular pockets is fitted into the roughing area in order to calculate highly efficient toolpaths (‘High speed cutting’). New version : This option activates a new calculation method for the toolpaths. Improved handling of rest material and large side infeeds shorten the machining times on the machine tool. The new method will replace the old one in the long term. In Rest Roughing mode, machine the rest material areas remaining after a roughing job based on the resulting stock. Finish pass : If this option is enabled, it ensures the tool moves along the entire defined contour, even if no material is cleared. If there is still some rest material, this is cleared first and then the finish path is performed. You should always enable this option if minor changes were made to the allowance between two machining passes. If the Finish pass option is used in combination with the Parameters Machining area Manual top function, the stock model above the defined value is not taken into account in the cycle calculation. This can lead to a collision between the tool and the stock model. High feed machining : Only available if the options Use adaptive pocket and Adaptive pocket only have been enabled. In this case, machining takes place with a large lateral but small vertical infeed and a high feedrate. The lateral infeed (1) is based on the defined scallop height (2). A lateral infeed > 50% of the tool diameter is possible. Complete machining of corners (3). Smooth rolling in at the start (4).

Use adaptive pocket : Activate for the optimized complete machining of closed (1) or half-open (2) adaptive pockets. The adaptive pocket area is machined first (A). This is followed by contour-parallel machining of the remaining areas (B). Very little rest material remains. The method is particularly well suited to roughing parts with a high proportion of adaptive pockets. Here, the pocket shape is detected automatically, regardless of the orientation of the pocket in relation to the job frame (1). The Adaptive pocket technology automatically identifies oblong open areas as pockets, even if the Use adaptive pocket option is not selected (2). Advantage : few G1 movements. The Adaptive pocket only option will carry out optimized roughing only in the adaptive pocket area (A). Areas outside the recognized pocket shape (B) will not be machined. These can be machined in a later operation using a different tool (type). If the Adaptive pocket only option is activated, the Fillet all toolpaths function is activated by default (and cannot be deactivated). Adaptive pockets are machined at different feedrates: (A) Fullcut feedrate (initial cutting free of the material), (B) Normal feedrate (further machining), (C) Reduced feedrate (before corners), (D) Clearance feedrate (infeed movements to next machining plane). Grey: Feedrate value outside the displayed analysis area. The value for the Normal feedrate may be defined higher than the default value for the Feedrate XY (Technology dialog page). Use the Fullcut max. stepdown parameter to define the maximum permitted stepdown when performing full cuts. If this stepdown is smaller than the vertical stepdown, the full cut is performed in several planes (available for the Adaptive pocket only option). The Fullcut max. stepdown parameter limits the plunge angle of the tool as plunging is carried out in full cut.

With its High Performance Roughing , OPEN MIND provides a technology that is characterized by the following features: Constant load on the tool and machine during the entire machining. Feedrates that are adjusted dynamically to the machining situation Machining is always performed using climb milling. Feedrate for fast positioning movements Reposition The following applies to the two strategies Opening cut and Side mill only : Safety (1): axial movement (in the Z direction) away from the plane currently being machined. Default value: Clearance distance * 0.1. Feedrate : Value for the maximum achievable feedrate for all movements to reposition the tool without material removal. Infeed Dense area stepover (factor) (1): Lateral infeed for trochoidal movements in narrow, inaccessible areas. The value is multiplied by the Stepover (factor of diameter). A reduction in the horizontal stepover in narrow areas may be particularly useful for hard materials. Plunge feedrate : Minimum feedrate for plunge movement in closed pockets that cannot be accessed from the outside. Opening cut Adapt the vertical stepdown and the feedrate to the particular machining situation. Vertical stepdown (1): The number of stepovers for the vertical stepdown is calculated from the vertical stepdown defined on the Parameters tab (total infeed). Example: If the total infeed is 2 and the vertical stepdown for the opening cut is 0.5, machining occurs in 4 infeeds. Feedrate : Maximum feedrate for the opening cut. Min. feedrate : Enable to specify the minimum feedrate for the opening cut. A change in the feedrate for the opening cut may change the machining strategy for narrow areas (trochoidal > full cut). hyper MILL determines the most suitable strategy internally in terms of the shortest overall machining time, taking into account the feedrate value. Entry feedrate A targeted feedrate adjustment at the moment of entry into the material can be especially useful with hard workpiece materials. Factor side entry regulates the lateral approach (not when the position is tangential to the contour) from outside and is referenced to the feedrate XY of the tool. Factor plunge entry affects the helical or ramp plunge into the material from above. This factor is calculated with plunge feedrate. Zigzag Zag feedrate (factor) : Factor influencing the feedrate of the opposite direction. If climb milling is chosen as cutting mode, the opposite direction feedrate, i.e. the conventional milling feedrate, is reduced by the specified factor. The 0.8 factor means a feedrate reduction of 20%. " },

In 3D machining, it is not possible to resolve a collision involving the tool extension , holder and\/or spindle by extending the tool (see calculating the tool length) or a collision will occur with the thick shank . If a collision cannot be avoided by changing the tool orientation (5X) or tool length calculation, various options are available for the machining strategies: Stop : The toolpath calculation stops when a collision occurs (applies for all machining strategies). Clip : The toolpath is fully calculated. Only the collision-free areas of the toolpaths are output. As a result of rework machining with another tool and\/or another tool inclination, the toolpaths found in the collision can be tracked and checked for collisions (applies to all 3D machining strategies). Collision avoidance : With this option, the tool is side-stepped to avoid collision so that the material can be machined as deeply as possible with the most robust possible tool. The toolpaths calculated for the Clip option are used as the basis for the 3D Rework Machining cycle. An area is determined and graphically displayed within the 3D Automatic Rest Machining cycle. Any further machining occurs within the following cycle only: 3D Automatic Rest Machining . When the Collision avoidance function is used, a milling area that is not within the stock is also protected against collisions. If the milling area that is outside of the stock only consists of perpendicular surfaces, no collision avoidance takes place; instead, the milling path output is suppressed. " },

XY optimization Areas that are not optimally machined with the selected profile direction (X or Y axis) can be optionally machined in a further operation in the opposite profile direction. The XY optimization can either be carried out without considering the surface steepness (option: Standard ) or dependent on the slope (option: Slope mode ). Example : The following options are enabled in the example: The machining area was limited by means of Milling surfaces and an automatic milling surface extension. The X axis option is activated as the infeed strategy. The Machining mode Slope mode option is enabled by default for the XY optimization Slope mode function. The slope angle for the surface steepness is set to 50° (option: To ). Off : No XY optimization takes place. Standard : In order to completely machine even the steep areas, an additional operation is optionally carried out in the opposite direction to the selected profile direction. Slope-dependent machining is not possible. Before is used to perform the optimization first, that is, machining takes place in the opposite direction to the selected profile direction and then in the standard direction, using the After option, the optimization is performed after the standard machining. If the Only optimization option is selected, no machining takes place in the standard direction. Slope mode : As in the case of the standard option, an additional operation can be optionally defined. Here, machining is carried out dependent on the surface slope, which is measured orthogonally to the machining direction. In the Basic path , any pitches are accepted in the machining direction, orthogonally only up to the angle that is defined in the To option. Steeply sloping or rising surfaces transverse to the machining direction are therefore not machined in this step. In the optimization step, the areas omitted in the basic toolpath are machined with a separate toolpath, so that complete machining is easily achieved. Optimization either takes place before (option: Before ) or after the machining (option: After ). Only optimization : Machining of the steep surface areas. When the Basic path only option is used, no optimization is performed, which means that the machining can also be split into two different jobs. Machining takes place in the transition area between steep and non-steep areas always with a smooth overlap (the Smooth overlap option is enabled by default). Machining mode The machining of surfaces with a large slope angle frequently leads to unsatisfactory results during Profile Finishing as a large amount of rest material remains. To save machining time, steep surface areas can be optionally excluded from machining, in dependence on their slope, by specifying a maximum surface slope angle. Slope mode : Enable if slope-dependent machining should take place and use From to define the lower limit and To to define the upper limit of the surface slope of the surfaces to be machined. Slope-dependent machining is only possible with bullnose end mills and ball mills. Grouping toolpaths : Machining areas are combined and the number of fast travel movements is reduced, particularly in the case of nested boundaries or in slope-dependent machining, if several milling areas have been defined. (1) Option not activated, (2) Option activated. Smooth overlap : Only available for slope dependent machining. Enable if you want the toolpaths of flat and steep areas to overlap.

Method for calculating the scallop height (1) Scallop height ( R th ) , (2) Tool diameter ( d ), (3) Minimum horizontal stepover ( br ) Minimum horizontal stepover : Limits the distance between the milling paths. Avoids machining that is too fine when the required scallop height cannot be reached because of very steep side surfaces. Apply this for machining areas with steep side surfaces (surface slope > 50°) and very smooth surfaces. Constant on curve projection : A guide curve is projected onto the surfaces and stepped equally on the basis of the specified infeed. This significantly improves surface quality. The minimum horizontal stepover limits the distance of the paths, particularly in steep areas. Only one profile (spline, line, curve) can be defined. Vertical surfaces cannot be machined.

Extend (1): if there is a tool extension, holder or spindle collision, hyper MILL will calculate a larger tool reach, based on the tool reach defined for the tool. So, there is no limit to the maximum tool reach – the maximum possible tool reach of a real tool is simply ignored! This is the preferred option if the selected tool is available in different lengths (e.g., short, long, extra-long) and the length calculation has not yet determined the suitable real tool for the assembly. In this case, the tool is merely a geometry description with an unlimited shank length. Reduce (2): hyper MILL calculates the shortest possible collision-free tool reach, based on the defined tool reach of the tool. This is the preferred option if you only want to calculate tool lengths that are also actually possible for the tool selected in the assembly. In this assembly, you must select the maximum tool reach as the tool reach.

In 3D machining, it is not possible to resolve a collision involving the tool extension , holder and\/or spindle by extending the tool (see calculating the tool length) or a collision will occur with the thick shank . If a collision cannot be avoided by changing the tool orientation (5X) or tool length calculation, various options are available for the machining strategies: Stop : The toolpath calculation stops when a collision occurs (applies for all machining strategies). Clip : The toolpath is fully calculated. Only the collision-free areas of the toolpaths are output. As a result of rework machining with another tool and\/or another tool inclination, the toolpaths found in the collision can be tracked and checked for collisions (applies to all 3D machining strategies). Collision avoidance : With this option, the tool is side-stepped to avoid collision so that the material can be machined as deeply as possible with the most robust possible tool. The toolpaths calculated for the Clip option are used as the basis for the 3D Rework Machining cycle. An area is determined and graphically displayed within the 3D Automatic Rest Machining cycle. Any further machining occurs within the following cycle only: 3D Automatic Rest Machining . When the Collision avoidance function is used, a milling area that is not within the stock is also protected against collisions. If the milling area that is outside of the stock only consists of perpendicular surfaces, no collision avoidance takes place; instead, the milling path output is suppressed. " },

The best settings are automatically used based on the tool diameter and the selected  Use case ( Semi finishing , Finishing , Fine finishing , Micro finishing ). Semi finishing : The tolerances are designed for semi-finishing. Finishing : The tolerances are adapted to general finishing. Fine finishing : The tolerances are adapted to high-precision finishing (particularly high requirements of the components in terms of accuracy and surface quality). Micro finishing : The tolerances are adapted to high-precision finishing of very small components. We recommend using this mode only for very small component sizes, as the calculation time and data volume can otherwise increase drastically. For  Mode  specify whether the toolpath is calculated in  Standard  mode or in  High-precision surface mode . The available use cases represent the typical machining steps during a milling operation. High precision surface mode : Use when maximum accuracy is required to calculate the toolpath. The calculation of the toolpath is not based on the faceted model geometry, but on the real surfaces of the model. Only available for  Ball mill . True Shape point distribution : Activate to redistribute points and guarantee an even and machine control-friendly distribution of points. To guarantee the best possible distribution of points, use the function CAM Plan . The machining cycle automatically takes into account the topology information that was created with the HPM milling task in the CAM plan. Filter points : Points that are located on straight toolpath sections, for example a planar surface, and are therefore not required, are filtered out. Function is not activated (1), Function is activated (2) Please note that no or fewer points are not always the best solution for all machine controls. For more detailed information, please contact the respective machine manufacturer. Cross align points : Align the points across the entire toolpath perpendicular to each other (i.e. at right angles to the toolpath direction). Function is not activated (1), Function is activated (2) Feedrate adaption : Activate to automatically adjust the feedrate depending on the curvature of the part. The feedrate is reduced for concave curvatures (1) and increased for convex curvatures (2). This means that the real contact feedrate of the tool on the part surface remains constant. Function is not activated (1), Function is activated (2) 3D path compensation : Available for the  Ball mill  tool type. Enables various NC controls to machine the model with a smaller or larger tool than actually programmed in  hyper MILL . In addition to the X, Y and Z coordinates, the direction vectors I, J and K to the surface contact point must also be known. Protect edges : When using the CAM plan, edges on the part are treated so that they are not damaged during machining. This is achieved by inserting additional points in areas where sharp edges were previously found in the component using the  HPM Milling  task. The 3D path compensation function is available only with a specially adjusted postprocessor. Without this adjustment, the NC program cannot correct this output and, as a result, both the component and machine may be damaged if the milling geometry used differs from the milling geometry used to calculate the toolpath.

For information on the machining sequence and cutting mode, see sections Machining sequence and Cutting mode. Machining priority Axial sorting : Areas like corners or pockets are sorted axially and machined consecutively, so that empty paths and machining times are reduced. Prefer spiral: Machining is performed in one continuous toolpath with a complete or an approximate spiral-shaped, vertical stepdown. Allow zigzag : Machining occurs with an alternating orientation\/cutting mode. Mode Shape offset (A): The shape of the toolpaths follows the defined bottom surfaces (2). Surface (3) and depth (4) must be defined as an offset to the bottom surfaces. Machining below the bottom surfaces is not possible. The Bottom parameter must therefore be >= 0. Z Level (B): Machining is carried out level by level. Surface (3) and depth (4) are defined automatically by hyper MILL based on the defined model. Alternatively, both can also be manually defined directly on the model. Geometry Bottom surfaces (2): Additional surfaces with which the shape of the toolpaths and the vertical machining area are defined.

To save time these surface areas can be excluded from machining with the Slope mode in dependence on their slope angle. Slope angle : Enter the minimum surface slope angle.

Collision avoidance : With this option, the tool is side-stepped to avoid collision so that the material can be machined as deeply as possible with the most robust possible tool. The toolpaths calculated for the Clip option are used as the basis for the 3D Rework Machining cycle. An area is determined and graphically displayed within the 3D Automatic Rest Machining cycle. Any further machining occurs within the following cycle only: 3D Automatic Rest Machining . When the Collision avoidance function is used, a milling area that is not within the stock is also protected against collisions. If the milling area that is outside of the stock only consists of perpendicular surfaces, no collision avoidance takes place; instead, the milling path output is suppressed. " },

"body" : "Tolerance use cases : Use the parameters of the tolerance use cases to ensure the best possible tolerances depending on the individual machining situation. The best settings are automatically used based on the diameter of the tool and the selected reference job . Semi finishing : The tolerances are designed for semi-finishing. Finishing : The tolerances are adapted to general finishing. Fine finishing : The tolerances are adapted to high-precision finishing (particularly high requirements of the components in terms of accuracy and surface quality). Micro finishing : The tolerances are adapted to high-precision finishing of very small components. We recommend using this mode only for very small component sizes, as the calculation time and data volume can otherwise increase drastically. For Mode , specify whether the toolpath is calculated in Standard mode or in High precision surface mode. High precision surface mode : Use when maximum accuracy is required to calculate the toolpath. The calculation of the toolpath is not based on the faceted model geometry, but on the real surfaces of the model. Only available for  Ball mill . True Shape point distribution : Activate to redistribute points and guarantee an even and machine control-friendly distribution of points. To guarantee the best possible distribution of points, use the function CAM Plan . The machining cycle automatically takes into account the topology information that was created with the HPM milling task in the CAM plan. Filter points : Points that are located on straight toolpath sections, for example a planar surface, and are therefore not required, are filtered out. Function is not activated (1), Function is activated (2) Please note that no or fewer points are not always the best solution for all machine controls. For more detailed information, please contact the respective machine manufacturer. Feedrate adaption : Activate to automatically adjust the feedrate depending on the curvature of the part. The feedrate is reduced for concave curvatures (1) and increased for convex curvatures (2). This means that the real contact feedrate of the tool on the part surface remains constant. Function is not activated (1), Function is activated (2) 3D path compensation : Available for the  Ball mill  tool type. Enables various NC controls to machine the model with a smaller or larger tool than actually programmed in  hyper MILL . In addition to the X, Y and Z coordinates, the direction vectors I, J and K to the surface contact point must also be known. Protect edges : When using the CAM plan, edges on the component are treated in such a way that they are not damaged during machining. This is realized by inserting additional points in those areas where sharp edges were previously found in the component with the task HPM milling . The 3D path compensation function is available only with a specially adjusted postprocessor. Without this adjustment, the NC program cannot correct this output and, as a result, both the component and machine may be damaged if the milling geometry used differs from the milling geometry used to calculate the toolpath. To adjust your postprocessor, please contact your OPEN MIND partner. " },

Tool reference On (1): Machining of the defined area until the tool axis is on top of the boundary. The tool axis can never move beyond the boundary. Offset (2): Any given offset value can be chosen.

The offset option is suitable for pre-machining with rough boundary. Here too, unmachined areas may result. Contact : The milling path ends as soon as there is no longer contact between the tool geometry and the surface limited by the boundary. This ensures complete machining of the surface. Depending on the slope angle of the surface, the boundary may be crossed. Without neighboring surfaces there is a danger of “nose-diving\". Boundary tolerance : This is only possible for contact edge behavior. Offsets the boundary with the specified value, thereby avoiding the risk of ‘nose-diving’ in the border area.

If a collision cannot be avoided by changing the tool orientation (5X) or tool length calculation, various options are available for the machining strategies: Stop : The toolpath calculation stops when a collision occurs (applies for all machining strategies). Clip : The toolpath is fully calculated. Only the collision-free areas of the toolpaths are output. As a result of rework machining with another tool and\/or another tool inclination, the toolpaths found in the collision can be tracked and checked for collisions (applies to all 3D machining strategies). Collision avoidance : With this option, the tool is side-stepped to avoid collision so that the material can be machined as deeply as possible with the most robust possible tool. The toolpaths calculated for the Clip option are used as the basis for the 3D Rework Machining cycle. An area is determined and graphically displayed within the 3D Automatic Rest Machining cycle. Any further machining occurs within the following cycle only: 3D Automatic Rest Machining . When the Collision avoidance function is used, a milling area that is not within the stock is also protected against collisions. If the milling area that is outside of the stock only consists of perpendicular surfaces, no collision avoidance takes place; instead, the milling path output is suppressed. " },

"body" : "Tolerance use cases : Use the parameters of the tolerance use cases to ensure the best possible tolerances depending on the individual machining situation. The best settings are automatically used based on the diameter of the tool and the selected Use case (Semi finishing , Finishing , Fine finishing , Micro finishing ). Semi finishing : The tolerances are designed for semi-finishing. Finishing : The tolerances are adapted to general finishing. Fine finishing : The tolerances are adapted to high-precision finishing (particularly high requirements of the components in terms of accuracy and surface quality). Micro finishing : The tolerances are adapted to high-precision finishing of very small components. We recommend using this mode only for very small component sizes, as the calculation time and data volume can otherwise increase drastically. For  Mode  specify whether the toolpath is calculated in  Standard  mode or in  High-precision surface mode . The available use cases represent the typical machining steps during a milling operation. High precision surface mode : Use when maximum accuracy is required to calculate the toolpath. The calculation of the toolpath is not based on the faceted model geometry, but on the real surfaces of the model. Only available for  Ball mill . True Shape point distribution : Activate to redistribute points and guarantee an even and machine control-friendly distribution of points. To guarantee the best possible distribution of points, use the function CAM Plan . The machining cycle automatically takes into account the topology information that was created with the HPM milling task in the CAM plan. Filter points : Points that are located on straight toolpath sections, for example a planar surface, and are therefore not required, are filtered out. Function is not activated (1), Function is activated (2) Please note that no or fewer points are not always the best solution for all machine controls. For more detailed information, please contact the respective machine manufacturer. Feedrate adaption : Activate to automatically adjust the feedrate depending on the curvature of the part. The feedrate is reduced for concave curvatures (1) and increased for convex curvatures (2). This means that the real contact feedrate of the tool on the part surface remains constant. Function is not activated (1), Function is activated (2) 3D path compensation : Available for the  Ball mill  tool type. Enables various NC controls to machine the model with a smaller or larger tool than actually programmed in  hyper MILL . In addition to the X, Y and Z coordinates, the direction vectors I, J and K to the surface contact point must also be known. The 3D path compensation function is available only with a specially adjusted postprocessor. Without this adjustment, the NC program cannot correct this output and, as a result, both the component and machine may be damaged if the milling geometry used differs from the milling geometry used to calculate the toolpath. To adjust your postprocessor, please contact your OPEN MIND partner. " },

When the plane level detection is enabled, this stock allowance also applies to the Z direction. Additional allowance XY : this additional horizontal stock allowance enables machining with different stock allowances for the bottom and side walls of the machining area. Example 1 : Roughing a pocket with a final horizontal stock allowance of 1 mm and simultaneous finishing of the bottom of the pocket (stock allowance = 0 mm). Inputs: allowance = 0, additional allowance XY = 1. Example 2 : The bottom of a pocket should have a final allowance of 0.5 mm while the side walls should have a final allowance of 1 mm. Inputs: Allowance = 0.5, Additional allowance XY = 0.5 Example 3 : The bottom of a pocket should have a final allowance of 0.5 mm while the side walls should not have an allowance. Inputs: allowance = 0.5, additional allowance XY = - 0.5. Stock allowance and the additional horizontal stock allowance can be defined as negative values if the following requirements have been met: Allowance + Corner radius > 0. Additional allowance XY + Tool radius - Corner radius > 0. Max. step height : Enable if large axial infeeds are possible and, despite this, a continuous allowance is to be achieved. An initial downwards vertical stepdown (1) is executed. The remaining material on inclined walls is then removed from bottom to top according to the defined Max. step height (2). Valid values for the Max. step height parameter must be less than or equal to the Vertical stepdown. The actual step height may differ from the Max. step height. Example calculation of the actual step height: Vertical stepdown = 7, Max. step height = 2 7: 2 = 3.5, rounded up = 4. 7:4 = 1.75 = actual step height. The strategy is particularly suitable for the high-performance machining of sloped walls and flat transitions. Max. step height not enabled (1), Max. step height enabled (2). Additional parameters Minimal stock removal : Value for the minimum material width between the stock and the model in order for material to be removed. If the material width is lower than the defined value, no material is removed. For values greater than 0, collision avoidance is automatically enabled, thus ensuring that the tool is continuously monitored against the tracked stock. Recommendation for calculating the minimal stock removal: stock tolerance + machining tolerance + required minimum removal = Minimal stock removal . If the Minimal stock removal function is enabled, the Vertical stepdown value can be exceeded by up to 25%. Finish pass all levels : If this option is enabled, it ensures the tool moves along the entire defined contour, even if no material is cleared. If there is still some rest material, this is cleared first and then the spring path is traversed. You should always enable this option if minor changes were made to the allowance between two machining passes. " },

In a second, automatically generated roughing pass the rest material left on the plane-parallel surfaces is removed. Optimized - planes only (4): only the plane-parallel surfaces inside the boundary are machined. Planar surfaces on the same level as the top or bottom are not recognized in this mode. Therefore please increase\/reduce the Top\/Bottom settings accordingly. Additional horizontal offset factor : The tool behavior can be modified by specifying an additional horizontal offset factor (recommended value 0.1 to 0.5). This yields better results, in particular when machining smaller planar surfaces with a larger tool. Optimized infeeds (1) by way of smooth, stretched infeeds between the single equidistant cuts in the roughing level reduce the tool wear and tear and ensure smoother machine movements.

With its High Performance Roughing , OPEN MIND provides a technology that is characterized by the following features: Constant load on the tool and machine during the entire machining. Feedrates that are adjusted dynamically to the machining situation Machining is always performed using climb milling. Feedrate for fast positioning movements Reposition The following applies to the two strategies Opening cut and Side mill only : Safety (1): axial movement (in the Z direction) away from the plane currently being machined. Default value: Clearance distance * 0.1. Feedrate : Value for the maximum achievable feedrate for all movements to reposition the tool without material removal. Infeed Dense area stepover (factor) (1): Lateral infeed for trochoidal movements in narrow, inaccessible areas. The value is multiplied by the Stepover (factor of diameter). A reduction in the horizontal stepover in narrow areas may be particularly useful for hard materials. Plunge feedrate : Minimum feedrate for plunge movement in closed pockets that cannot be accessed from the outside. Opening cut Adapt the vertical stepdown and the feedrate to the particular machining situation. Vertical stepdown (1): The number of stepovers for the vertical stepdown is calculated from the vertical stepdown defined on the Parameters tab (total infeed). Example: If the total infeed is 2 and the vertical stepdown for the opening cut is 0.5, machining occurs in 4 infeeds. Feedrate : Maximum feedrate for the opening cut. Min. feedrate : Enable to specify the minimum feedrate for the opening cut. A change in the feedrate for the opening cut may change the machining strategy for narrow areas (trochoidal > full cut). hyper MILL determines the most suitable strategy internally in terms of the shortest overall machining time, taking into account the feedrate value. Entry feedrate A targeted feedrate adjustment at the moment of entry into the material can be especially useful with hard workpiece materials. Factor side entry regulates the lateral approach (not when the position is tangential to the contour) from outside and is referenced to the feedrate XY of the tool. Factor plunge entry affects the helical or ramp plunge into the material from above. This factor is calculated with plunge feedrate. Zigzag Zag feedrate (factor) : Factor influencing the feedrate of the opposite direction. If climb milling is chosen as cutting mode, the opposite direction feedrate, i.e. the conventional milling feedrate, is reduced by the specified factor. The 0.8 factor means a feedrate reduction of 20%. " },

"body" : "Machining sequence Plane (1): Machining is carried out level by level. The selected approach and retract macros are executed in each plane. Pocket (2): Contour pockets or islands are machined in sequence. If there are several boundaries, these are machined in sequence. If a user-defined plunge point is also present, machining only takes place within the related boundary. In addition, select cutting mode and infeed mode. The vertical infeed (stepdown) is carried out level by level. In each Z-level the selected approach and retract macros will be executed. In addition, select cutting mode and infeed mode. Prefer spiral : Machining is performed in one continuous toolpath with a complete (1) or an approximate spiral-shaped (2) vertical stepdown. Macros are only carried out at the start and the end of the path. In addition, select the cutting mode. Slope dependent machining is not available for spiral-shaped infeed. Zigzag (3): Machining with alternating cutting mode. Connect strategy Ramp connect : Level-by-level machining with ramp-shaped, filleted stepdown between the levels. The last toolpath will be closed. Advantage compared to the complete spiral machining is the shorter calculation time while obtaining the same surface quality results. Connect factor : Defines the length of the ramp as follows: Ramp length = Tool diameter x Factor. This value should be defined with consideration of the stepdown distance and the machine kinematics. If the connect factor is 0, infeed takes place in a complete spiral-shaped vertical path. The first and last toolpaths are machined as closed paths in one level. Between these there will be a spiral-shaped toolpath. Zigzag: Machining with alternating orientation. The selected approach and retract macros are executed for the approach of the first NC path and the retraction from the last passed NC path. If a Return macro is activated, every retract and infeed movement is corrected by the selected retract and approach macro. Infeed mode The infeed mode applies to the vertical stepdown to the next workplane within a machining area. Rapid: A rapid retract movement to the clearance distance\/plane takes place between the approach and retract macros of the two machining planes. Always applies when multiple pockets are machined during level-by-level machining. Direct (1): The infeed movement from the end point of the retract macro to the start point of the approach macro is carried out on the shortest path at the feedrate. Smooth (2): The stepdown between the end position of the retract macro and the start point of the approach macro are filleted (rounded). If this infeed mode is used in combination with circular approach and retract macros, the result will be a helical transition between the toolpaths. Such loop-shaped paths reduce jolting and mechanical load on the machine. Toolpath fillets Fillet interior corners : Smooth filleting (rounding) of internal milling paths at the corners of contour pockets or islands. Fillet radius : Abrupt changes in direction within the cutting toolpaths are rounded with the specified radius. Machining mode Slope mode : During Z Level Finishing, the machining of surfaces with a small slope angle only leads to unsatisfactory quality (a lot of rest material). To save time, these surfaces can be optionally excluded from machining, in dependence on their slope. Slope dependent machining is only possible with bullnose end mills and ball mills, and cannot be used in conjunction with a spiral strategy. Slope angle : Enter the minimum surface slope angle. Only those areas will be machined which have a larger slope angle. The flat areas not machined here can be machined with the 3D Finishing cycle in slope mode. There the steep surface areas are excluded from machining. Smooth overlap : Only available for slope dependent machining. Enable if you want the toolpaths of flat and steep areas to overlap. The overlap (1) ensures a very high level of surface quality in the transition area between flat and steep surfaces. (2) Transition area activated, (3) Transition area not activated. The overlap area is visualized in the graphic for illustrative purposes only. This area is not graphically highlighted in the model.

"body" : "Allowance Allowance (1): remaining material on the workpiece. Calculated in direction of the surface normals. Added to the Clearance parameter during machining (see section Check tool ). Additional allowance XY : Additional horizontal stock allowance enables machining with different stock allowances for the bottom and side walls of the machining area. Vertical infeed mode The infeed mode defines the mode of computation for the distance between the particular NC paths. Constant stepdown (1): machining with a fixed infeed depth. Enter the increment for the vertical stepdown . Scallop height (2) : A pre-defined scallop height is not exceeded during machining. The Z-distance between the individual milling paths depends on the surface curvature and steepness. It is calculated over the cutting plane and the smallest value found is used for machining. Scallop height value : Enter the required scallop height. The Scallop height infeed mode will significantly increase the calculation time for the milling paths. Minimum vertical stepdown : Limits the distance between the milling paths. Avoids machining that is too fine when the required scallop height cannot be retained because of very steep side surfaces. Apply this for machining areas with steep side surfaces (surface slope > 40°) and very smooth surfaces. Maximal vertical stepdown : Upper limit for the vertical distance of the toolpaths for preventing tool breakages. Plane level detection Off : The defined vertical stepdown is kept for each roughing level irrespective of the workpiece surface. Automatic (1): If the defined vertical stepdown value is greater than the distance between two surfaces of the workpiece, the system automatically inserts an intermediate step with a smaller vertical stepdown value for the planar surfaces of the workpiece. Only planar faces (2): available only for the constant stepdown mode. Only the plane-parallel surfaces inside the boundary are machined, but not cleared. Therefore, you must use another machining strategy to clear the planar surfaces. Planar surfaces on the same level as the top or bottom are not recognized in this mode. Therefore please increase\/reduce the Top\/Bottom settings accordingly. Path compensation The Compensated path function may be used for path compensation. If the Compensated path option is enabled and the Return macro is disabled, a warning is given and the return macro is activated. If the macro length is 0, it is aborted with an error. Production mode : Rapid tool movements occur as the shortest link between the infeed planes, while taking into account a possibly defined allowance. This minimizes the number of empty paths. If a direct lateral link is not possible, a collision-free polygonal movement is made. Side clearance \/ Axial clearance : Minimum distance in a lateral (1) or axial (2) direction from the surface of the machined part. Clearance that can be travelled without a collision. " },

In 3D machining, it is not possible to resolve a collision involving the tool extension , holder and\/or spindle by extending the tool (see calculating the tool length) or a collision will occur with the thick shank . If a collision cannot be avoided by changing the tool orientation (5X) or tool length calculation, various options are available for the machining strategies: Stop : The toolpath calculation stops when a collision occurs (applies for all machining strategies). Clip : The toolpath is fully calculated. Only the collision-free areas of the toolpaths are output. As a result of rework machining with another tool and\/or another tool inclination, the toolpaths found in the collision can be tracked and checked for collisions (applies to all 3D machining strategies). Collision avoidance : With this option, the tool is side-stepped to avoid collision so that the material can be machined as deeply as possible with the most robust possible tool. The toolpaths calculated for the Clip option are used as the basis for the 3D Rework Machining cycle. An area is determined and graphically displayed within the 3D Automatic Rest Machining cycle. Any further machining occurs within the following cycle only: 3D Automatic Rest Machining . When the Collision avoidance function is used, a milling area that is not within the stock is also protected against collisions. If the milling area that is outside of the stock only consists of perpendicular surfaces, no collision avoidance takes place; instead, the milling path output is suppressed. " },

"body" : "Vertical stepdown (1): The vertical stepdown determines the number of machining planes. Allowance (2): remaining material on the workpiece. Calculated in direction of the surface normals. Added to the Clearance parameter during machining (see section Check tool). For the 3D Arbitrary Stock Roughing cycle, the distance between the tool and the stock and model is specified by the defined clearance only. If the XY allowance is negative, end mills are not allowed. If a bullnose end mill is used, the negative XY allowance must be smaller or equal to the tool radius minus the corner radius. Example : tool radius (5 mm) - corner radius (4 mm) = 1 mm. The stock allowance only applies for surfaces. For areas where there are no surfaces present there will be no stock allowance calculated. Z constant machining: In the last machining level, the allowance only applies in X and Y direction, not in Z direction. The specification of negative stock allowances is possible as long as the sum of (negative) stock allowance and tool corner radius does not become negative. When specifying negative stock allowances, surface gaps should not exceed the following maximum values (otherwise, risk of ‘nose-diving’): 2 x (tool radius + negative allowance). Additional allowance XY : Additional horizontal stock allowance enables machining with different stock allowances for the bottom and side walls of the machining area. Limitations : If the sum of the allowances is negative, the total amount must be less than the tool radius - machining tolerance. Example : tool radius = 5.00 mm, machining tolerance = 0.01 mm, allowance = -3.0 mm. Additional allowance XY must be greater than -1.99 mm, e.g. - 1.98, for |-3.00mm +(-1.98mm)| < 5.00mm -0.01mm.

"body" : "Infeed strategy Equidistant : Machining with constant infeed. Profiles (1): It is possible to select multiple closed profiles (boundaries) that are not nested. Offset : The selected profile curves are offset with the defined value (positive\/negative). Use as 3D curve : The selected profile curves are not projected onto the machining surfaces. Machining always takes place parallel to a contour and the limited area is machined in Axis mode. The path ends when the tool axis is located on the curve. Path direction \/ Stepover direction The path direction is either Clockwise or Counterclockwise . The stepover direction is either inside-out or outside-in . Toolpath connection Skip first path : The first toolpath (1) is calculated but not machined. Avoids double machining when the selected machining curve has been extracted from the toolpath in the last machining plane of a preceding plane-by-plane cycle (for example, Z Level Finishing). Connect factor : Length and rounding of the ramp-shaped transition between the planes, depending on the tool diameter. Ramp length = Tool diameter x Connect factor. The Connect factor value should be defined in relation to the path distance (infeed) and the machine kinematics. The larger the factor, the smoother the connection transition between the paths will be, but a larger factor will also increase the calculation time. (2) Connect factor = 0.5, (3) Connect factor = 2. Infeed strategy Flow : This strategy is particularly suitable for HSC machining. Profiles : Two guide curves (1, 2), which do not intersect and that have the same direction, must be defined as profiles. Reverse direction If the guide curves are in an opposed direction, reverse the direction of one guide curve (1st profile \/ 2nd profile). In the case of closed curves, the start positions must be aligned, that is, are not displaced from one another. In the default setting, the first milling path runs on the inner (shorter) guide curve and the first infeed is executed to the left of the first milling path. Synchronize toolpaths Equal (A): The two guide curves are divided up into the same number of segments. The start and end points of the respective part segments are linked. Distance (B): Here, synchronisation uses lines with the shortest distance in each case between the first and second guide curve. Make sure that a unique point on the second curve is allocated to each point on the first curve and that this second point has the shortest distance to the first point from the direction of the tool axis. Spiral : The toolpaths are interpolated so that they form a spiral-like movement. " },

"body" : "The infeed mode describes the type of horizontal stepover between the end point of a milling path and the start point of the following path. The Infeed mode does not apply to the Pocket profile. With the options Zigzag direct and Zigzag smooth , the machining direction changes after each passed profile. An approach macro is used for the infeed to the first milling path and a retract macro is used for retraction after the last milling path. If the linear movement would cause damage to the workpiece, the system guides the tool with surface contact (no material being removed) around the workpiece. Zigzag direct : If no return macro is enabled (1), the infeed movement is carried out on the shortest path in the machining feedrate (G1) on the surface. If a return macro is enabled (2), every retract and infeed movement is corrected by the selected retract and approach macro. Depending on the defined retract mode, the horizontal stepover occurs at the clearance distance in G1 or at the clearance plane in G0. Zigzag smooth : The infeed between the milling paths is the shape of loop. These loops reduce jolting and the mechanical load on the machine is reduced. This strategy is primarily intended for high-speed milling. The limiting boundary may be traversed when moving along the loops. With the Diagonal and Parallel options, the machining direction is always the same and defined by the profile direction. The horizontal stepover is performed relative to the defined retract mode to the security clearance in G1 or security plane in G0. Each retract and infeed movement is corrected by the selected approach and retract macro. When the Diagonal option (1) is used, the infeed is diagonal from the end point to the next start point. When the Parallel (2) option is used, the tool initially retracts parallel to the generated milling path to the start point of the (vertical) infeed movement. This is followed by a horizontal stepover using the shortest distance possible. " },

"body" : "Vertical stepdown (1): The vertical stepdown determines the number of machining planes. Allowance (2): remaining material on the workpiece. Calculated in direction of the surface normals. Added to the Clearance parameter during machining (see section Check tool). For the 3D Arbitrary Stock Roughing cycle, the distance between the tool and the stock and model is specified by the defined clearance only. If the XY allowance is negative, end mills are not allowed. If a bullnose end mill is used, the negative XY allowance must be smaller or equal to the tool radius minus the corner radius. Example : tool radius (5 mm) - corner radius (4 mm) = 1 mm. The stock allowance only applies for surfaces. For areas where there are no surfaces present there will be no stock allowance calculated. Z constant machining: In the last machining level, the allowance only applies in X and Y direction, not in Z direction. The specification of negative stock allowances is possible as long as the sum of (negative) stock allowance and tool corner radius does not become negative. When specifying negative stock allowances, surface gaps should not exceed the following maximum values (otherwise, risk of ‘nose-diving’): 2 x (tool radius + negative allowance). Additional allowance XY : Additional horizontal stock allowance enables machining with different stock allowances for the bottom and side walls of the machining area. Limitations : If the sum of the allowances is negative, the total amount must be less than the tool radius - machining tolerance. Example : tool radius = 5.00 mm, machining tolerance = 0.01 mm, allowance = -3.0 mm. Additional allowance XY must be greater than -1.99 mm, e.g. - 1.98, for |-3.00mm +(-1.98mm)| < 5.00mm -0.01mm.

The retraction can also be performed as a Ramp . These additional movements are only ever performed if they do not result in a collision with neighboring surfaces. The approach or retract movement is performed smoothly in a circular motion. Plunge macro Various plunge strategies for infeed movement to the next machining level are available for all level-by-level machining cycles (except Z Level Finishing). Axial (A): The infeed is executed as a linear movement in Z direction. Use the axial plunge macro for: Infeed without stock removal (user-defined plunge point is outside of stock or boundary). Pre-drilling at the existing user-defined plunge point. Axial plunging with a tool suitable for vertical chip removal. Helical (B): used to remove the stock of 3D pockets. Helix radius (1): offset of the cutter center point relative to the axis of the helix (= Z axis through plunge point). Angle (2): lead angle of the helix. The number of revolutions executed by the tool in the course of the infeed movement is computed from the value of the vertical stepdown and the lead angle of the helix. The helix direction is defined by the selected orientation (climb\/conventional milling).Lead angle of the helix. The number of revolutions executed by the tool in the course of the infeed movement is computed from the value of the vertical stepdown and the lead angle of the helix.

Approach macro \/ Retract macro Retract macros are additional movements during infeed on the first milling path of a job, infeeds between the milling paths via the clearance plane or clearance distance. The following approach macros are available depending on the machining cycle: Axial , Perpendicular , Circular , Tangential as well as the Ramp macro for level-by-level material removal. During roughing, the approach macros only apply to the Finish pass during machining parallel to the axis. Retract macros are additional motions during retraction after the last milling path of a cycle, retraction for horizontal stepover between the milling paths via the clearance plane or clearance distance. The following approach macros are available depending on the machining cycle. Axial (1): Linear movement along the tool axis towards or away from the part. Enter length of movement. Closed and concave (inner) contours. Circular (2): Approach and retract movements are performed in a quarter circle. Enter radius of the circle.

Closed and concave (inner) contours. Level-by-level machining (2): Approach and retract movements are performed in the machining plane along the contour tangent. Ramp (1): this approach macro is exclusively available for level-by-level machining. Soft cutting along the path. Applicable for machining in tight areas where the first infeed for finishing could lead to contour violations or collision due to peaks in the material. Return macros (2): Return macros are possible during machining with alternating orientation (zigzag strategies). The following applies here: the horizontal stepover between the milling paths takes place via the clearance distance or clearance plane. The activated approach and retract macro is carried out during each retract and infeed movement. Macros normal to surfaces : The approach and retract macros are executed in the direction of the surface normals.

"body" : "Vertical stepdown (1): The vertical stepdown determines the number of machining planes. Allowance (2): remaining material on the workpiece. Calculated in direction of the surface normals. Added to the Clearance parameter during machining (see section Check tool). For the 3D Arbitrary Stock Roughing cycle, the distance between the tool and the stock and model is specified by the defined clearance only. If the XY allowance is negative, end mills are not allowed. If a bullnose end mill is used, the negative XY allowance must be smaller or equal to the tool radius minus the corner radius. Example : tool radius (5 mm) - corner radius (4 mm) = 1 mm. The stock allowance only applies for surfaces. For areas where there are no surfaces present there will be no stock allowance calculated. Z constant machining: In the last machining level, the allowance only applies in X and Y direction, not in Z direction. The specification of negative stock allowances is possible as long as the sum of (negative) stock allowance and tool corner radius does not become negative. When specifying negative stock allowances, surface gaps should not exceed the following maximum values (otherwise, risk of ‘nose-diving’): 2 x (tool radius + negative allowance). Additional allowance XY : Additional horizontal stock allowance enables machining with different stock allowances for the bottom and side walls of the machining area. Limitations : If the sum of the allowances is negative, the total amount must be less than the tool radius - machining tolerance. Example : tool radius = 5.00 mm, machining tolerance = 0.01 mm, allowance = -3.0 mm. Additional allowance XY must be greater than -1.99 mm, e.g. - 1.98, for |-3.00mm +(-1.98mm)| < 5.00mm -0.01mm.

If a collision cannot be avoided by changing the tool orientation (5X) or tool length calculation, various options are available for the machining strategies: Stop : The toolpath calculation stops when a collision occurs (applies for all machining strategies). Clip : The toolpath is fully calculated. Only the collision-free areas of the toolpaths are output. As a result of rework machining with another tool and\/or another tool inclination, the toolpaths found in the collision can be tracked and checked for collisions (applies to all 3D machining strategies).

If a collision cannot be avoided by changing the tool orientation (5X) or tool length calculation, various options are available for the machining strategies: Stop : The toolpath calculation stops when a collision occurs (applies for all machining strategies). Clip : The toolpath is fully calculated. Only the collision-free areas of the toolpaths are output. As a result of rework machining with another tool and\/or another tool inclination, the toolpaths found in the collision can be tracked and checked for collisions (applies to all 3D machining strategies). Collision avoidance : With this option, the tool is side-stepped to avoid collision so that the material can be machined as deeply as possible with the most robust possible tool. The toolpaths calculated for the Clip option are used as the basis for the 3D Rework Machining cycle. An area is determined and graphically displayed within the 3D Automatic Rest Machining cycle. Any further machining occurs within the following cycle only: 3D Automatic Rest Machining . When the Collision avoidance function is used, a milling area that is not within the stock is also protected against collisions. If the milling area that is outside of the stock only consists of perpendicular surfaces, no collision avoidance takes place; instead, the milling path output is suppressed. " },

Please contact your OPEN MIND partner for further information on VIRTUAL Machining Center . OPEN MIND recommends defining the toolpath in such a manner that no tension-release rotations are necessary . It is possible that the geometry to be machined will need to be broken up into multiple jobs, or it may be necessary to define alternative toolpaths. This may increase the complexity of the toolpath definition. OPEN MIND recommends proceeding with extreme care with these toolpaths if tension-release rotations cannot be avoided. The entire sequence for the tension-release toolpath – from the retract movement from the workpiece up to the re-approach – is not collision checked ! If a postprocessor run with stored solutions is performed, the NC file contains no rewind. OPEN MIND additionally recommends taking appropriate measures to first successfully test and execute the tension-release toolpaths, such as for example test runs above or next to the part, or without the part in place. Jobs which include tension-release rotations should be run separately on the machine if possible (not as part of an NC program with multiple operations). Using additional verification software for NC programs can help increase safety. OPEN MIND recommends using the VIRTUAL Machining Center . These tips are intended to help successfully execute the defined toolpaths and prevent damage to the CNC machine. Please contact your OPEN MIND partner if you have further questions on this topic.

Inclination strategy Fixed : Fixed tool inclination in the entire machining area. Automatic Tool orientation calculated automatically around C axis. Comparing to former version tool paths smoothing of 4th axis (C) as well as automatic collision avoidance is always switched on. The A\/B axis requires a tilt angle definition. If required, hyper MILL may change the tilt angle control at a later point if collision avoidance for the A\/B axis has been enabled. Using Holder \/ Tip , specify the area of the tool that is to be aligned to the Z axis of the machining frame. Rigid guiding : The tool is rigidly aligned to the Z axis of the frame. If the option is disabled, the orientation of this axis may be changed due to automatic smoothing and\/or collision avoidance. Tilt angle control : The A\/B axis requires tilt angle definition. Additional lead angle : In addition to tilt angle control, a lead angle can be specified for the tool. Offset on XY plane : In the case of end mills and bullnose end mills, you can offset the tool axis to the Z axis as an alternative to using the lead angle. Collision avoidance : If required, hyper MILL may change the tilt angle control at a later point if collision avoidance for the A\/B axis has been enabled. Manual inclination curve The movement of both rotary axes can largely be guided independently of the surface formation of the machining area, using the user-defined inclination curve. Compared to the offset strategy, a more harmonious movement sequence around the Z axis of the selected frame can be achieved. The inclination curve should be only roughly oriented to the profile of the surfaces, have a smooth profile without abrupt changes in direction, enable continuous movements of the rotary axes. Orientation of 4th axis (C) is calculated as shortest distance towards curve from Z-view of current frame. 3D-information of the curve does not influence tool orientation around 4th axis (C)! (1) C axis, (2) Toolpath (length), (A) Offset curve, (B) Manual curve Setup: C axis Holder \/ Tip : Defines whether the curve guides the tool tip or tool holder. Rigid guiding : If rigid guiding for the curve is not activated, the orientation can be modified by means of smoothing and\/or collision avoidance around the C axis by hyper MILL®. If strict orientation to manual curve or frame Z-axis is required, this switch must not be disabled! Setup A\/B axis A distinction is made between three modes: For all 3 options, the tool orientation can be modified by hyper MILL® subsequently for the A\/B axis if collision avoidance is activated. Consider curve : If Consider curve is not activated, the 3D information of the curve is not used. The height of the curve has no influence on the angle of the A\/B axis, because the tilt angle of the milling tool will stay unchanged. If Consider curve is enabled, two different options are available. Through : Creates a tool inclination at which the tool axis intersects the curve at every point. Toward : If the tool axis arrives at the curve, the tool is positioned to it, possibly up to a perpendicular position. Depending on the machining conditions, this can allow the tilt angle and the movement guidance of the second rotary axis to be influenced using the Z height of the manual inclination curve. Toward (in connection with Tool holder ): The manual inclination curve (1) is used for orienting the tool shank\/tool holder. It normally lies in front of the surface to be machined from the tool axis perspective. Constant tilt angle (1): To attain a constant tilt angle, the manual curve must be defined so that overlapping with the tool axis is avoided during machining. The manual inclination curve should normally be as deep as possible. If necessary, create several jobs with different radial curves. Deactivate the Consider curve option. Modifiable tilt angle (2): To avoid collisions between tool shank and model surfaces of the opposite wall, set the manual inclination curve high enough in order to position the tool onto it while the machining depth is increasing. Smooth tilting of the second rotary axis For back-and-forth machining of basic surfaces, it is also recommended to set the manual inclination curve higher. Since the positioning of the tool on the manual inclination curve then begins earlier and ends later, it results in a smoother movement guidance of the second rotary axis. Toward (in connection with Tool tip ): The manual inclination curve (1) is used for orienting the tool tip. It normally lies behind the surface to be machined from the tool axis perspective. The manual inclination curve allows for, in particular, a specific definition of the position direction for convex surfaces. Constant tilt angle To attain a constant tilt angle, the manual inclination curve must be defined such that overlapping with the tool axis is avoided during machining. If necessary, create several jobs with different manual curves. Deactivate the Consider curve option. Modifiable tilt angle If the tilt angle changes as machining progresses, then the machining direction and the shape and positioning of the radial curve should be selected such that the tool axis has to cut the radial curve. For example, it is recommended for back-and-forth machining that the radial curve is set lower. Since the positioning of the tool on the radial curve begins earlier and ends later, it results in a smoother movement guidance of the second rotary axis. Offset curve : The offset curve (1) is used for orienting the tool shank. With this strategy, the system forms a curve that corresponds to the defined offset value in each machining level for the calculated center path of the tool. Comparing to former version tool paths smoothing of 4th axis (C) as well as automatic collision avoidance is always switched on. The surfaces to be machined must not be too flat, as there is then the possibility that no useful offset curves can be formed. Offset : Using the offset value, you can control how precisely the inclination of the milling tool follows the surface profiles. Large offset values reduce the rotary motion around the Z axis in small narrow areas. However, they increase the danger of the offset curve breaking down into numerous, separate curves. If the offset strategy results in a large number rotary motions around the Z axis that are not necessary for milling, the Manual curve option should be used. If it is not possible to avoid a breakdown into individual curves, the machining should be divided up into several jobs with different machining areas and different offsets. Setup: A\/B axis Tilt angle control: The current frame is the reference coordinate system for the tilt angle control. The frame can be tilted with respect to the NCS for machining undercuts and achieving an optimum flow of the NC data. " },

"body" : "Vertical stepdown (1): The vertical stepdown determines the number of machining planes. Allowance (2): remaining material on the workpiece. Calculated in direction of the surface normals. Added to the Clearance parameter during machining (see section Check tool). For the 3D Arbitrary Stock Roughing cycle, the distance between the tool and the stock and model is specified by the defined clearance only. If the XY allowance is negative, end mills are not allowed. If a bullnose end mill is used, the negative XY allowance must be smaller or equal to the tool radius minus the corner radius. Example : tool radius (5 mm) - corner radius (4 mm) = 1 mm. The stock allowance only applies for surfaces. For areas where there are no surfaces present there will be no stock allowance calculated. Z constant machining: In the last machining level, the allowance only applies in X and Y direction, not in Z direction. The specification of negative stock allowances is possible as long as the sum of (negative) stock allowance and tool corner radius does not become negative. When specifying negative stock allowances, surface gaps should not exceed the following maximum values (otherwise, risk of ‘nose-diving’): 2 x (tool radius + negative allowance). Additional allowance XY : Additional horizontal stock allowance enables machining with different stock allowances for the bottom and side walls of the machining area. Limitations : If the sum of the allowances is negative, the total amount must be less than the tool radius - machining tolerance. Example : tool radius = 5.00 mm, machining tolerance = 0.01 mm, allowance = -3.0 mm. Additional allowance XY must be greater than -1.99 mm, e.g. - 1.98, for |-3.00mm +(-1.98mm)| < 5.00mm -0.01mm. The polyhedron offset is also taken into account as the stock allowance (see dialog Milling area > Definition). If several values are defined here, only the smallest value is taken into account.

An approach macro is used for the infeed to the first milling path and a retract macro is used for retraction after the last milling path. If the linear movement would cause damage to the workpiece, the system guides the tool with surface contact (no material being removed) around the workpiece. Zigzag direct : If no return macro is enabled (1), the infeed movement is carried out on the shortest path in the machining feedrate (G1) on the surface. If a return macro is enabled (2), every retract and infeed movement is corrected by the selected retract and approach macro. Depending on the defined retract mode, the horizontal stepover occurs at the clearance distance in G1 or at the clearance plane in G0.

This strategy is primarily intended for high-speed milling. The limiting boundary may be traversed when moving along the loops.

The horizontal stepover is performed relative to the defined retract mode to the security clearance in G1 or security plane in G0.

Scallop height (2): Machining is only possible with ball mills. A predefined scallop height is not exceeded even on steep side surfaces.

The complete Z-level is taken into consideration and the smallest value found is used to determine the stepdown. Scallop height value : Enter the required scallop height. The Scallop height infeed mode will significantly increase the calculation time for the milling paths. Minimum horizontal stepover : Limits the distance between the milling paths. Avoids machining that is too fine when the required scallop height cannot be reached because of very steep side surfaces. Apply this for machining areas with steep side surfaces (surface slope > 50°) and very smooth surfaces.

Inclination strategy Fixed : Fixed tool inclination in the entire machining area. Automatic : All milling movements in G1 are, if possible, carried out automatically with a fixed orientation in order to achieve maximum speed and stability. When using rotary axes, a constant simultaneous movement of the rotary axes is possible thanks to the pre-analysis and evaluation of the entire toolpath segment. Preferred tilt angle : Define a starting inclination which – if possible – is maintained for the entire toolpath. If the preferred tilt angle is not used, a vertical alignment is preferred. Using Holder \/ Tip , specify the area of the tool that is to be aligned to the Z axis of the machining frame. Rigid guiding : The tool is rigidly aligned to the Z axis of the frame. If the option is disabled, the orientation of this axis may be changed due to automatic smoothing and\/or collision avoidance. Tilt angle control : The A\/B axis requires tilt angle definition. Additional lead angle : In addition to tilt angle control, a lead angle can be specified for the tool. Offset on XY plane : In the case of end mills and bullnose end mills, you can offset the tool axis to the Z axis as an alternative to using the lead angle. Collision avoidance : If required, hyper MILL may change the tilt angle control at a later point if collision avoidance for the A\/B axis has been enabled. Manual inclination curve The movement of both rotary axes can largely be guided independently of the surface formation of the machining area, using the user-defined inclination curve. Compared to the offset strategy, a more harmonious movement sequence around the Z axis of the selected frame can be achieved. The inclination curve should be only roughly oriented to the profile of the surfaces, have a smooth profile without abrupt changes in direction, enable continuous movements of the rotary axes. Orientation of 4th axis (C) is calculated as shortest distance towards curve from Z-view of current frame. 3D-information of the curve does not influence tool orientation around 4th axis (C)! (1) C axis, (2) Toolpath (length), (A) Offset curve, (B) Manual curve Setup: C axis Holder \/ Tip : Defines whether the curve guides the tool tip or tool holder. Rigid guiding : If rigid guiding for the curve is not activated, the orientation can be modified by means of smoothing and\/or collision avoidance around the C axis by hyper MILL®. If strict orientation to manual curve or frame Z-axis is required, this switch must not be disabled! Setup A\/B axis A distinction is made between three modes: For all 3 options, the tool orientation can be modified by hyper MILL® subsequently for the A\/B axis if collision avoidance is activated. Consider curve : If Consider curve is not activated, the 3D information of the curve is not used. The height of the curve has no influence on the angle of the A\/B axis, because the tilt angle of the milling tool will stay unchanged. If Consider curve is enabled, two different options are available. Through : Creates a tool inclination at which the tool axis intersects the curve at every point. Toward : If the tool axis arrives at the curve, the tool is positioned to it, possibly up to a perpendicular position. Depending on the machining conditions, this can allow the tilt angle and the movement guidance of the second rotary axis to be influenced using the Z height of the manual inclination curve. Toward (in connection with Tool holder ): The manual inclination curve (1) is used for orienting the tool shank\/tool holder. It normally lies in front of the surface to be machined from the tool axis perspective. Constant tilt angle (1): To attain a constant tilt angle, the manual curve must be defined so that overlapping with the tool axis is avoided during machining. The manual inclination curve should normally be as deep as possible. If necessary, create several jobs with different radial curves. Deactivate the Consider curve option. Modifiable tilt angle (2): To avoid collisions between tool shank and model surfaces of the opposite wall, set the manual inclination curve high enough in order to position the tool onto it while the machining depth is increasing. Smooth tilting of the second rotary axis For back-and-forth machining of basic surfaces, it is also recommended to set the manual inclination curve higher. Since the positioning of the tool on the manual inclination curve then begins earlier and ends later, it results in a smoother movement guidance of the second rotary axis. Toward (in connection with Tool tip ): The manual inclination curve (1) is used for orienting the tool tip. It normally lies behind the surface to be machined from the tool axis perspective. The manual inclination curve allows for, in particular, a specific definition of the position direction for convex surfaces. Constant tilt angle To attain a constant tilt angle, the manual inclination curve must be defined such that overlapping with the tool axis is avoided during machining. If necessary, create several jobs with different manual curves. Deactivate the Consider curve option. Modifiable tilt angle If the tilt angle changes as machining progresses, then the machining direction and the shape and positioning of the radial curve should be selected such that the tool axis has to cut the radial curve. For example, it is recommended for back-and-forth machining that the radial curve is set lower. Since the positioning of the tool on the radial curve begins earlier and ends later, it results in a smoother movement guidance of the second rotary axis. Offset curve : The offset curve (1) is used for orienting the tool shank. With this strategy, the system forms a curve that corresponds to the defined offset value in each machining level for the calculated center path of the tool. Comparing to former version tool paths smoothing of 4th axis (C) as well as automatic collision avoidance is always switched on. The surfaces to be machined must not be too flat, as there is then the possibility that no useful offset curves can be formed. Offset : Using the offset value, you can control how precisely the inclination of the milling tool follows the surface profiles. Large offset values reduce the rotary motion around the Z axis in small narrow areas. However, they increase the danger of the offset curve breaking down into numerous, separate curves. If the offset strategy results in a large number rotary motions around the Z axis that are not necessary for milling, the Manual curve option should be used. If it is not possible to avoid a breakdown into individual curves, the machining should be divided up into several jobs with different machining areas and different offsets. Setup: A\/B axis Tilt angle control: The current frame is the reference coordinate system for the tilt angle control. The frame can be tilted with respect to the NCS for machining undercuts and achieving an optimum flow of the NC data. " },

If a collision cannot be avoided by changing the tool orientation (5X) or tool length calculation, various options are available for the machining strategies: Stop : The toolpath calculation stops when a collision occurs (applies for all machining strategies). Clip : The toolpath is fully calculated. Only the collision-free areas of the toolpaths are output. As a result of rework machining with another tool and\/or another tool inclination, the toolpaths found in the collision can be tracked and checked for collisions (applies to all 3D machining strategies). Collision avoidance : With this option, the tool is side-stepped to avoid collision so that the material can be machined as deeply as possible with the most robust possible tool. The toolpaths calculated for the Clip option are used as the basis for the 3D Rework Machining cycle. An area is determined and graphically displayed within the 3D Automatic Rest Machining cycle. Any further machining occurs within the following cycle only: 3D Automatic Rest Machining .

The best settings are automatically used based on the diameter of the tool and the selected Use case (Semi finishing , Finishing , Fine finishing , Micro finishing ). Semi finishing : The tolerances are designed for semi-finishing. Finishing : The tolerances are adapted to general finishing. Fine finishing : The tolerances are adapted to high-precision finishing (particularly high requirements of the components in terms of accuracy and surface quality). Micro finishing : The tolerances are adapted to high-precision finishing of very small components. We recommend using this mode only for very small component sizes, as the calculation time and data volume can otherwise increase drastically. For  Mode  specify whether the toolpath is calculated in  Standard  mode or in  High-precision surface mode . The available use cases represent the typical machining steps during a milling operation. High precision surface mode : Use when maximum accuracy is required to calculate the toolpath. The calculation of the toolpath is not based on the faceted model geometry, but on the real surfaces of the model. Only available for  Ball mill . True Shape point distribution : Activate to redistribute points and guarantee an even and machine control-friendly distribution of points. To guarantee the best possible point distribution, use the  CAM Plan  function. The machining cycle automatically takes into account the topology information that was created with the  HPM–Milling  task in the CAM plan.

Function is not activated (1), Function is activated (2) Please note that no or fewer points are not always the best solution for all machine controls. For more detailed information, please contact the respective machine manufacturer. Cross align points : Align the points across the entire toolpath perpendicular to each other (i.e. at right angles to the toolpath direction). Function is not activated (1), Function is activated (2) Feedrate adaption : Activate to automatically adjust the feedrate depending on the curvature of the part. The feedrate is reduced for concave curvatures (1) and increased for convex curvatures (2). This means that the real contact feedrate of the tool on the part surface remains constant. Function is not activated (1), Function is activated (2) 3D path compensation : Available for the  Ball mill  tool type. Enables various NC controls to machine the model with a smaller or larger tool than actually programmed in  hyper MILL . In addition to the X, Y and Z coordinates, the direction vectors I, J and K to the surface contact point must also be known. Protect edges : When using the CAM plan, edges on the part are treated so that they are not damaged during machining. This is achieved by inserting additional points in areas where sharp edges were previously found in the component using the  HPM Milling  task. The 3D path compensation function is available only with a specially adjusted postprocessor. Without this adjustment, the NC program cannot correct this output and, as a result, both the component and machine may be damaged if the milling geometry used differs from the milling geometry used to calculate the toolpath. To adjust your postprocessor, please contact your OPEN MIND partner. " },

The vertical infeed (stepdown) is carried out level by level. In each Z-level the selected approach and retract macros will be executed. In addition, select cutting mode and infeed mode. Prefer spiral: Machining is performed in one continuous toolpath with a complete (1) or an approximate spiral-shaped (2) vertical stepdown. Macros are only carried out at the start and the end of the path. In addition, select the cutting mode. Slope dependent machining is not available for spiral-shaped infeed. Zigzag (3): Machining with alternating cutting mode. Connect strategy Ramp connect : Level-by-level machining with ramp-shaped, filleted stepdown between the levels. The last toolpath will be closed. Advantage compared to the complete spiral machining is the shorter calculation time while obtaining the same surface quality results. Connect factor : Defines the length of the ramp as follows: Ramp length = Tool diameter x Factor. This value should be set with consideration of the stepdown distance and the machine kinematics. If the connect factor is 0, infeed takes place in a complete spiral-shaped vertical path. The first and last toolpaths are machined as closed paths in one level. Between these there will be a spiral-shaped toolpath. Zigzag : Machining with alternating orientation. The selected approach and retract macros are executed for the approach of the first NC path and the retraction from the last passed NC path. If a Return macro is activated, every retract and infeed movement is corrected by the selected retract and approach macro. Infeed mode The infeed mode applies to the vertical stepdown to the next workplane within a machining area. Rapid : A rapid retract movement to the clearance distance\/plane takes place between the approach and retract macros of the two machining planes. Always applies when multiple pockets are machined during level-by-level machining. Direct (1): The infeed movement from the end point of the retract macro to the start point of the approach macro is carried out on the shortest path at the feedrate. Smooth (2): The stepdown between the end position of the retract macro and the start point of the approach macro are filleted (rounded). If this infeed mode is used in combination with circular approach and retract macros, the result will be a helical transition between the toolpaths. Such loop-shaped paths reduce jolting and mechanical load on the machine. Toolpath fillets Fillet interior corners : Smooth filleting (rounding) of internal milling paths at the corners of contour pockets or islands. Fillet radius : Abrupt changes in direction within the cutting toolpaths are rounded with the specified radius. Machining mode Slope mode : During Z Level Finishing, the machining of surfaces with a small slope angle only leads to unsatisfactory quality (a lot of rest material). To save time, these surfaces can be optionally excluded from machining, in dependence on their slope. Slope dependent machining is only possible with bullnose end mills and ball mills, and cannot be used in conjunction with a spiral strategy. Slope angle : Enter the minimum surface slope angle. Only those areas will be machined which have a larger slope angle. The flat areas not machined here can be machined with the 3D Finishing cycle in slope mode. There the steep surface areas are excluded from machining. Options Bottom to top milling : Activate when machining is to take place from bottom to top. " },

Scallop height value : Enter the required scallop height. The Scallop height infeed mode will significantly increase the calculation time for the milling paths. Minimum vertical stepdown : Limits the distance between the milling paths. Avoids machining that is too fine when the required scallop height cannot be retained because of very steep side surfaces. Apply this for machining areas with steep side surfaces (surface slope > 40°) and very smooth surfaces. Maximal vertical stepdown : Upper limit for the vertical distance of the toolpaths for preventing tool breakages. " },

Inclination strategy Fixed : Fixed tool inclination in the entire machining area. Automatic : All milling movements in G1 are, if possible, carried out automatically with a fixed orientation in order to achieve maximum speed and stability. When using rotary axes, a constant simultaneous movement of the rotary axes is possible thanks to the pre-analysis and evaluation of the entire toolpath segment. Preferred tilt angle : Define a starting inclination which – if possible – is maintained for the entire toolpath. If the preferred tilt angle is not used, a vertical alignment is preferred. Using Holder \/ Tip , specify the area of the tool that is to be aligned to the Z axis of the machining frame. Rigid guiding : The tool is rigidly aligned to the Z axis of the frame. If the option is disabled, the orientation of this axis may be changed due to automatic smoothing and\/or collision avoidance. Tilt angle control : The A\/B axis requires tilt angle definition. Additional lead angle : In addition to tilt angle control, a lead angle can be specified for the tool. Offset on XY plane : In the case of end mills and bullnose end mills, you can offset the tool axis to the Z axis as an alternative to using the lead angle. Collision avoidance : If required, hyper MILL may change the tilt angle control at a later point if collision avoidance for the A\/B axis has been enabled. Manual inclination curve The movement of both rotary axes can largely be guided independently of the surface formation of the machining area, using the user-defined inclination curve. Compared to the offset strategy, a more harmonious movement sequence around the Z axis of the selected frame can be achieved. The inclination curve should be only roughly oriented to the profile of the surfaces, have a smooth profile without abrupt changes in direction, enable continuous movements of the rotary axes. Orientation of 4th axis (C) is calculated as shortest distance towards curve from Z-view of current frame. 3D-information of the curve does not influence tool orientation around 4th axis (C)! (1) C axis, (2) Toolpath (length), (A) Offset curve, (B) Manual curve Setup: C axis Holder \/ Tip : Defines whether the curve guides the tool tip or tool holder. Rigid guiding : If rigid guiding for the curve is not activated, the orientation can be modified by means of smoothing and\/or collision avoidance around the C axis by hyper MILL®. If strict orientation to manual curve or frame Z-axis is required, this switch must not be disabled! Setup A\/B axis A distinction is made between three modes: For all 3 options, the tool orientation can be modified by hyper MILL® subsequently for the A\/B axis if collision avoidance is activated. Consider curve : If Consider curve is not activated, the 3D information of the curve is not used. The height of the curve has no influence on the angle of the A\/B axis, because the tilt angle of the milling tool will stay unchanged. If Consider curve is enabled, two different options are available. Through : Creates a tool inclination at which the tool axis intersects the curve at every point. Toward : If the tool axis arrives at the curve, the tool is positioned to it, possibly up to a perpendicular position. Depending on the machining conditions, this can allow the tilt angle and the movement guidance of the second rotary axis to be influenced using the Z height of the manual inclination curve. Toward (in connection with Tool holder ): The manual inclination curve (1) is used for orienting the tool shank\/tool holder. It normally lies in front of the surface to be machined from the tool axis perspective. Constant tilt angle (1): To attain a constant tilt angle, the manual curve must be defined so that overlapping with the tool axis is avoided during machining. The manual inclination curve should normally be as deep as possible. If necessary, create several jobs with different radial curves. Deactivate the Consider curve option. Modifiable tilt angle (2): To avoid collisions between tool shank and model surfaces of the opposite wall, set the manual inclination curve high enough in order to position the tool onto it while the machining depth is increasing. Smooth tilting of the second rotary axis For back-and-forth machining of basic surfaces, it is also recommended to set the manual inclination curve higher. Since the positioning of the tool on the manual inclination curve then begins earlier and ends later, it results in a smoother movement guidance of the second rotary axis. Toward (in connection with Tool tip ): The manual inclination curve (1) is used for orienting the tool tip. It normally lies behind the surface to be machined from the tool axis perspective. The manual inclination curve allows for, in particular, a specific definition of the position direction for convex surfaces. Constant tilt angle To attain a constant tilt angle, the manual inclination curve must be defined such that overlapping with the tool axis is avoided during machining. If necessary, create several jobs with different manual curves. Deactivate the Consider curve option. Modifiable tilt angle If the tilt angle changes as machining progresses, then the machining direction and the shape and positioning of the radial curve should be selected such that the tool axis has to cut the radial curve. For example, it is recommended for back-and-forth machining that the radial curve is set lower. Since the positioning of the tool on the radial curve begins earlier and ends later, it results in a smoother movement guidance of the second rotary axis. Offset curve : The offset curve (1) is used for orienting the tool shank. With this strategy, the system forms a curve that corresponds to the defined offset value in each machining level for the calculated center path of the tool. Comparing to former version tool paths smoothing of 4th axis (C) as well as automatic collision avoidance is always switched on. The surfaces to be machined must not be too flat, as there is then the possibility that no useful offset curves can be formed. Offset : Using the offset value, you can control how precisely the inclination of the milling tool follows the surface profiles. Large offset values reduce the rotary motion around the Z axis in small narrow areas. However, they increase the danger of the offset curve breaking down into numerous, separate curves. If the offset strategy results in a large number rotary motions around the Z axis that are not necessary for milling, the Manual curve option should be used. If it is not possible to avoid a breakdown into individual curves, the machining should be divided up into several jobs with different machining areas and different offsets. Setup: A\/B axis Tilt angle control: The current frame is the reference coordinate system for the tilt angle control. The frame can be tilted with respect to the NCS for machining undercuts and achieving an optimum flow of the NC data. " },

Tool reference On (1): Machining of the defined area until the tool axis is on top of the boundary. The tool axis can never move beyond the boundary. Offset (2): Any given offset value can be chosen. A positive value enlarges the boundary, while a negative value reduces it. With nested boundaries, a positive offset value enlarges the outer boundaries and reduces the inner boundaries (vice versa with negative offsets). An offset of 0 corresponds to the On mode. The offset option is suitable for pre-machining with rough boundary. Here too, unmachined areas may result. Contact : The milling path ends as soon as there is no longer contact between the tool geometry and the surface limited by the boundary. This ensures complete machining of the surface. Depending on the slope angle of the surface, the boundary may be crossed. Without neighboring surfaces there is a danger of “nose-diving\". Boundary tolerance : This is only possible for contact edge behavior. Offsets the boundary with the specified value, thereby avoiding the risk of ‘nose-diving’ in the border area. In general, an offset value of 0.2 mm is sufficient. Note that in some cases, in particular single surface situations, a finer setting may be required.

In 3D machining, it is not possible to resolve a collision involving the tool extension , holder and\/or spindle by extending the tool (see calculating the tool length) or a collision will occur with the thick shank . If a collision cannot be avoided by changing the tool orientation (5X) or tool length calculation, various options are available for the machining strategies: Stop : The toolpath calculation stops when a collision occurs (applies for all machining strategies). Clip : The toolpath is fully calculated. Only the collision-free areas of the toolpaths are output. As a result of rework machining with another tool and\/or another tool inclination, the toolpaths found in the collision can be tracked and checked for collisions (applies to all 3D machining strategies). Collision avoidance : With this option, the tool is side-stepped to avoid collision so that the material can be machined as deeply as possible with the most robust possible tool. The toolpaths calculated for the Clip option are used as the basis for the 3D Rework Machining cycle. An area is determined and graphically displayed within the 3D Automatic Rest Machining cycle. Any further machining occurs within the following cycle only: 3D Automatic Rest Machining . When the Collision avoidance function is used, a milling area that is not within the stock is also protected against collisions. If the milling area that is outside of the stock only consists of perpendicular surfaces, no collision avoidance takes place; instead, the milling path output is suppressed. " },

"body" : "Tolerance use cases : Use the parameters of the tolerance use cases to ensure the best possible tolerances depending upon the individual machining situation. The best settings are automatically used based on the tool diameter and the selected  Use case ( Semi finishing , Finishing , Fine finishing , Micro finishing ). Semi finishing : The tolerances are designed for semi-finishing. Finishing : The tolerances are adapted to general finishing. Fine finishing : The tolerances are adapted to high-precision finishing (particularly high requirements of the components in terms of accuracy and surface quality). Micro finishing : The tolerances are adapted to high-precision finishing of very small components. We recommend using this mode only for very small component sizes, as the calculation time and data volume can otherwise increase drastically. For  Mode  specify whether the toolpath is calculated in  Standard  mode or in  High-precision surface mode . The available use cases represent the typical machining steps during a milling operation. High precision surface mode : Use when maximum accuracy is required to calculate the toolpath. The calculation of the toolpath is not based on the faceted model geometry, but on the real surfaces of the model. Only available for  Ball mill . True Shape point distribution : Activate to redistribute points and guarantee an even and machine control-friendly distribution of points. To guarantee the best possible point distribution, use the  CAM Plan  function. The machining cycle automatically takes into account the topology information that was created with the  HPM–Milling  task in the CAM plan. Filter points : Points that are located on straight toolpath sections, for example a planar surface, and are therefore not required, are filtered out. Function is not activated (1), Function is activated (2) Please note that no or fewer points are not always the best solution for all machine controls. For more detailed information, please contact the respective machine manufacturer. Feedrate adaption : Activate to automatically adjust the feedrate depending on the curvature of the part. The feedrate is reduced for concave curvatures (1) and increased for convex curvatures (2). This means that the real contact feedrate of the tool on the part surface remains constant. Function is not activated (1), Function is activated (2) 3D path compensation : Available for the  Ball mill  tool type. Enables various NC controls to machine the model with a smaller or larger tool than actually programmed in  hyper MILL . In addition to the X, Y and Z coordinates, the direction vectors I, J and K to the surface contact point must also be known. The 3D path compensation function is available only with a specially adjusted postprocessor. Without this adjustment, the NC program cannot correct this output and, as a result, both the component and machine may be damaged if the milling geometry used differs from the milling geometry used to calculate the toolpath. To adjust your postprocessor, please contact your OPEN MIND partner. " },

Offset : The selected profile curves are offset with the defined value (positive\/negative). Use as 3D curve : The selected profile curves are not projected onto the machining surfaces. Machining always takes place parallel to a contour and the limited area is machined in Axis mode. The path ends when the tool axis is located on the curve. Path direction \/ Stepover direction The path direction is either Clockwise or Counterclockwise . The stepover direction is either inside-out or outside-in . Toolpath connection Skip first path : The first toolpath (1) is calculated but not machined. Avoids double machining when the selected machining curve has been extracted from the toolpath in the last machining plane of a preceding plane-by-plane cycle (for example, Z Level Finishing). Connect factor : Length and rounding of the ramp-shaped transition between the planes, depending on the tool diameter. Ramp length = Tool diameter x Connect factor. The Connect factor value should be defined in relation to the path distance (infeed) and the machine kinematics. The larger the factor, the smoother the connection transition between the paths will be, but a larger factor will also increase the calculation time. (2) Connect factor = 0.5, (3) Connect factor = 2. Infeed strategy Flow : This strategy is particularly suitable for HSC machining. Profiles : Two guide curves (1, 2), which do not intersect and that have the same direction, must be defined as profiles. Reverse direction If the guide curves are in an opposed direction, reverse the direction of one guide curve (1st profile \/ 2nd profile). In the case of closed curves, the start positions must be aligned, that is, are not displaced from one another. In the default setting, the first milling path runs on the inner (shorter) guide curve and the first infeed is executed to the left of the first milling path. Synchronize toolpaths Equal (A): The two guide curves are divided up into the same number of segments. The start and end points of the respective part segments are linked. Distance (B): Here, synchronisation uses lines with the shortest distance in each case between the first and second guide curve. Make sure that a unique point on the second curve is allocated to each point on the first curve and that this second point has the shortest distance to the first point from the direction of the tool axis.

The Infeed mode does not apply to the Pocket profile. With the options Zigzag direct and Zigzag smooth , the machining direction changes after each passed profile. An approach macro is used for the infeed to the first milling path and a retract macro is used for retraction after the last milling path. If the linear movement would cause damage to the workpiece, the system guides the tool with surface contact (no material being removed) around the workpiece. Zigzag direct : If no return macro is enabled (1), the infeed movement is carried out on the shortest path in the machining feedrate (G1) on the surface. If a return macro is enabled (2), every retract and infeed movement is corrected by the selected retract and approach macro. Depending on the defined retract mode, the horizontal stepover occurs at the clearance distance in G1 or at the clearance plane in G0. Zigzag smooth : The infeed between the milling paths is the shape of loop. These loops reduce jolting and the mechanical load on the machine is reduced. This strategy is primarily intended for high-speed milling. The limiting boundary may be traversed when moving along the loops. With the Diagonal and Parallel options, the machining direction is always the same and defined by the profile direction. The horizontal stepover is performed relative to the defined retract mode to the security clearance in G1 or security plane in G0. Each retract and infeed movement is corrected by the selected approach and retract macro. When the Diagonal option (1) is used, the infeed is diagonal from the end point to the next start point. When the Parallel (2) option is used, the tool initially retracts parallel to the generated milling path to the start point of the (vertical) infeed movement.

"body" : "Define the parameters for the linking movements between machining jobs with different frames. Distance angle limit : Angle difference for various tool inclinations between two separate machining areas (for example: drilling groups) of a model. If the defined value (default = 91°) is exceeded or it is equal to the defined value, the linking movement between the two machining areas takes place at the height of the clearance plane, even if Clearance distance is defined as the retract mode (Parameters dialog page) (1). If the angle value falls below the defined value, the linking movement takes place at the height of the clearance distance (dialog page: Parameters) (2). If there is no angle change, the tool moves rapidly to clearance distance. If there is no angle change, the tool moves rapidly to clearance distance. Clearance straighten angle : If the angle between the Z axis of the current machining frame and Z axis of the tool is greater than the defined straighten angle (default = 45°), the tool turns to the defined value for the straighten angle, after it has reached the clearance plane. If the angle between the Z axis of the current machining frame and Z axis of the tool is smaller than or equal to the defined Straighten angle, the tool moves to the clearance plane without changing the tool inclination (3). The clearance straighten angle provides collision avoidance, in particular for machines with conical interpolation that allow a 180° vector change The straighten angle must be defined so that the tip of the tool describes the deepest point of the entire collision body, including spindle and head. The Z axis of the frame must be parallel to the Z axis of the NCS. Clearance feedrate : Linking movements between two machining areas in the clearance distance are executed at this feedrate.

Extend (1): if there is a tool extension, holder or spindle collision, hyper MILL will calculate a larger tool reach, based on the tool reach defined for the tool. So, there is no limit to the maximum tool reach – the maximum possible tool reach of a real tool is simply ignored! This is the preferred option if the selected tool is available in different lengths (e.g., short, long, extra-long) and the length calculation has not yet determined the suitable real tool for the assembly. In this case, the tool is merely a geometry description with an unlimited shank length. Reduce (2): hyper MILL calculates the shortest possible collision-free tool reach, based on the defined tool reach of the tool. This is the preferred option if you only want to calculate tool lengths that are also actually possible for the tool selected in the assembly. In this assembly, you must select the maximum tool reach as the tool reach.

In 3D machining, it is not possible to resolve a collision involving the tool extension , holder and\/or spindle by extending the tool (see calculating the tool length) or a collision will occur with the thick shank . If a collision cannot be avoided by changing the tool orientation (5X) or tool length calculation, various options are available for the machining strategies: Stop : The toolpath calculation stops when a collision occurs (applies for all machining strategies). Clip : The toolpath is fully calculated. Only the collision-free areas of the toolpaths are output. As a result of rework machining with another tool and\/or another tool inclination, the toolpaths found in the collision can be tracked and checked for collisions (applies to all 3D machining strategies). Collision avoidance : With this option, the tool is side-stepped to avoid collision so that the material can be machined as deeply as possible with the most robust possible tool. The toolpaths calculated for the Clip option are used as the basis for the 3D Rework Machining cycle. An area is determined and graphically displayed within the 3D Automatic Rest Machining cycle. Any further machining occurs within the following cycle only: 3D Automatic Rest Machining . When the Collision avoidance function is used, a milling area that is not within the stock is also protected against collisions. If the milling area that is outside of the stock only consists of perpendicular surfaces, no collision avoidance takes place; instead, the milling path output is suppressed. " },

"body" : "Define the parameters for the linking movements between machining jobs with different frames. Distance angle limit : Angle difference for various tool inclinations between two separate machining areas (for example: drilling groups) of a model. If the defined value (default = 91°) is exceeded or it is equal to the defined value, the linking movement between the two machining areas takes place at the height of the clearance plane, even if Clearance distance is defined as the retract mode (Parameters dialog page) (1). If the angle value falls below the defined value, the linking movement takes place at the height of the clearance distance (dialog page: Parameters) (2). If there is no angle change, the tool moves rapidly to clearance distance. If there is no angle change, the tool moves rapidly to clearance distance. Clearance straighten angle : If the angle between the Z axis of the current machining frame and Z axis of the tool is greater than the defined straighten angle (default = 45°), the tool turns to the defined value for the straighten angle, after it has reached the clearance plane. If the angle between the Z axis of the current machining frame and Z axis of the tool is smaller than or equal to the defined Straighten angle, the tool moves to the clearance plane without changing the tool inclination (3). The clearance straighten angle provides collision avoidance, in particular for machines with conical interpolation that allow a 180° vector change The straighten angle must be defined so that the tip of the tool describes the deepest point of the entire collision body, including spindle and head. The Z axis of the frame must be parallel to the Z axis of the NCS. Clearance feedrate : Linking movements between two machining areas in the clearance distance are executed at this feedrate.

The computation of the path distance for ruled profiles and flow profiles can be controlled via user-defined synchronization lines. Constant stepover (1): Infeed with fixed horizontal increment. The vertical distance between the toolpaths (Z-Levels) is constant for all Z-levels Specify the horizontal stepover . Machining of steep surfaces causes steps in the surface. Possible remedies: Machining at an angle (turning the workpiece around the Z axis) Select Scallop height infeed mode. For round parts select one of the guide curve strategies. Scallop height (2): Machining is only possible with ball mills. A predefined scallop height is not exceeded even on steep side surfaces. The Z-distance between the individual milling paths depends on the surface curvature and steepness. The complete Z-level is taken into consideration and the smallest value found is used to determine the stepdown. Scallop height value : Enter the required scallop height. The Scallop height infeed mode will significantly increase the calculation time for the milling paths. Minimum horizontal stepover : Limits the distance between the milling paths. Avoids machining that is too fine when the required scallop height cannot be reached because of very steep side surfaces. Apply this for machining areas with steep side surfaces (surface slope > 50°) and very smooth surfaces. Constant on curve projection : A guide curve (1) is projected onto the surfaces and stepped equally on the basis of the specified infeed. This significantly improves surface quality. The minimum horizontal stepover limits the distance of the paths, particularly in steep areas. Only one profile (spline, line, curve) can be defined. Vertical surfaces cannot be machined.

Function is not activated (1), Function is activated (2) Feedrate adaption : Activate to automatically adjust the feedrate depending on the curvature of the part. The feedrate is reduced for concave curvatures (1) and increased for convex curvatures (2). This means that the real contact feedrate of the tool on the part surface remains constant. Function is not activated (1), Function is activated (2) 3D path compensation : Available for the  Ball mill  tool type. Enables various NC controls to machine the model with a smaller or larger tool than actually programmed in  hyper MILL . In addition to the X, Y and Z coordinates, the direction vectors I, J and K to the surface contact point must also be known. Protect edges : When using the CAM plan, edges on the part are treated so that they are not damaged during machining. This is achieved by inserting additional points in areas where sharp edges were previously found in the component using the  HPM Milling  task. The 3D path compensation function is available only with a specially adjusted postprocessor. Without this adjustment, the NC program cannot correct this output and, as a result, both the component and machine may be damaged if the milling geometry used differs from the milling geometry used to calculate the toolpath. To adjust your postprocessor, please contact your OPEN MIND partner. " },

The type of cut for the tool (Ascending, Descending, Ascending and descending) The infeed mode between the end point of the first milling path and the start point of the following milling path. The options that are available in the Profile definition, Type of cut and Infeed mode areas are explained in the following sections using examples. If a profile has not been defined, the defined boundary (strategy: Boundary curve) or the boundary for the defined milling surfaces (strategy: Milling surfaces) is used automatically as the profile. When the X axis and Y axis options are used, the X or Y axis of the frame is used as the guide curve. With all the other options, the guide curves are freely definable, which allows the milling paths to be optimally adapted to the surface. Machining angle : Enter the angle of rotation required for machining. The machining and infeed directions are based on the guide curves. This setting is the standard setting. Reverse direction Both the milling and infeed direction can be customized in order to make optimal adjustments to the milling paths to the surface. Milling path : Reverses the machining direction. Horizontal stepover : Reverses the infeed direction. Via the selected directions the starting point of machining is defined as well. Machining mode The machining of surfaces with a large slope angle frequently leads to unsatisfactory results during Profile Finishing as a large amount of rest material remains. To save machining time, steep surface areas can be optionally excluded from machining, in dependence on their slope, by specifying a maximum surface slope angle. Slope mode : Enable if slope-dependent machining should take place and use From to define the lower limit and To to define the upper limit of the surface slope of the surfaces to be machined. Slope dependent machining is only possible with bullnose endmills and ball mills. The steep areas not machined here can be machined with the 3D Z Level Finishing cycle in Slope mode. Here, the flat areas are excluded from machining.

An approach macro is used for the infeed to the first milling path and a retract macro is used for retraction after the last milling path. If the linear movement would cause damage to the workpiece, the system guides the tool with surface contact (no material being removed) around the workpiece. Zigzag direct : If no return macro is enabled (1), the infeed movement is carried out on the shortest path in the machining feedrate (G1) on the surface. If a return macro is enabled (2), every retract and infeed movement is corrected by the selected retract and approach macro. Depending on the defined retract mode, the horizontal stepover occurs at the clearance distance in G1 or at the clearance plane in G0.

This strategy is primarily intended for high-speed milling. The limiting boundary may be traversed when moving along the loops.

Scallop height (2): Machining is only possible with ball mills. A predefined scallop height is not exceeded even on steep side surfaces.

The complete Z-level is taken into consideration and the smallest value found is used to determine the stepdown. Scallop height value : Enter the required scallop height. The Scallop height infeed mode will significantly increase the calculation time for the milling paths. Minimum horizontal stepover : Limits the distance between the milling paths. Avoids machining that is too fine when the required scallop height cannot be reached because of very steep side surfaces. Apply this for machining areas with steep side surfaces (surface slope > 50°) and very smooth surfaces.

Clip : The toolpath is fully calculated. Only the collision-free areas of the toolpaths are output. As a result of rework machining with another tool and\/or another tool inclination, the toolpaths found in the collision can be tracked and checked for collisions (applies to all 3D machining strategies).

The toolpaths can be oriented to the X or Y axis or to a freely definable profile. 5X Iso Top Milling (2): Here, the tool inclination at the contact point is calculated with a freely specifiable slope angle to the normal of face in the infeed direction. The toolpaths are oriented to the U or V lines of the surface(s) or the selected synchronization lines. 5X Contouring (3): 5X contour machining is particularly suited to shape elements that are milled with a defined tool inclination to the surface, such as grooves, cut edges or engravings. Using optional synchronization lines, the tool inclination can be manually adjusted locally. 5X SWARF Cutting 1 Curve (4): The cycle is used for regular surfaces that permit a milling tool to come into contact with a line. The machining area in the axial direction is defined by a profile curve. The tool inclination is determined by the surface to be milled. The use of end mills with swarf machining enables short machining times. 5X SWARF Cutting 2 Curves (5): The cycle is used for regular surfaces that permit a milling tool to come into contact with a line. For swarf cutting with two curves, the machining area in the axial direction is also defined by a profile curve. As opposed to swarf cutting with one curve, the tool inclination here is defined by an additional profile curve. The use of end mills with swarf machining enables short machining times. 5X Shape Offset Roughing (6): Roughing of slightly curved surfaces with a uniform allowance, whereby the milling path follows the selected drive surfaces. Bottom surfaces may be defined for machining, making individual adjustments possible. 5X Shape Offset Finishing (7): Finishing of slightly curved surfaces with a uniform allowance, whereby the milling path follows the selected drive surfaces Bottom and stop surfaces may be defined for machining, whereby individual adjustments are possible. Tangent Plane Machining (MAXX Machining) (8): Finishing of planar surfaces with barrel tools. Simple operation through automatic adjustment of the tool inclination to the surface(s) to be milled. The automatic collision check guarantees optimal process safety. A high degree of efficiency through the combination of machining strategies and tool shapes. Tangent Machining (9) Tangential finishing of curved surfaces. Definition of the contact point of the tool by automatically generated Iso curves or Z-constant curves.

If this is not possible, a tool path with the connect factor 0.0 is generated. In both cases, a corresponding message will be displayed.

"body" : "Vertical stepdown (1): The vertical stepdown determines the number of machining planes. Allowance (2): remaining material on the workpiece. Calculated in direction of the surface normals. Added to the Clearance parameter during machining (see section Check tool). For the 3D Arbitrary Stock Roughing cycle, the distance between the tool and the stock and model is specified by the defined clearance only. If the XY allowance is negative, end mills are not allowed. If a bullnose end mill is used, the negative XY allowance must be smaller or equal to the tool radius minus the corner radius. Example : tool radius (5 mm) - corner radius (4 mm) = 1 mm. The stock allowance only applies for surfaces. For areas where there are no surfaces present there will be no stock allowance calculated. Z constant machining: In the last machining level, the allowance only applies in X and Y direction, not in Z direction. The specification of negative stock allowances is possible as long as the sum of (negative) stock allowance and tool corner radius does not become negative. When specifying negative stock allowances, surface gaps should not exceed the following maximum values (otherwise, risk of ‘nose-diving’): 2 x (tool radius + negative allowance). Additional allowance XY : Additional horizontal stock allowance enables machining with different stock allowances for the bottom and side walls of the machining area. Limitations : If the sum of the allowances is negative, the total amount must be less than the tool radius - machining tolerance. Example : tool radius = 5.00 mm, machining tolerance = 0.01 mm, allowance = -3.0 mm. Additional allowance XY must be greater than -1.99 mm, e.g. - 1.98, for |-3.00mm +(-1.98mm)| < 5.00mm -0.01mm. The polyhedron offset is also taken into account as the stock allowance (see dialog Milling area > Definition). If several values are defined here, only the smallest value is taken into account.

Clip : The toolpath is fully calculated. Only the collision-free areas of the toolpaths are output. As a result of rework machining with another tool and\/or another tool inclination, the toolpaths found in the collision can be tracked and checked for collisions (applies to all 3D machining strategies).

Linking movement Define the parameters for the linking movements between the drill holes. Only available for the 5X Drilling drilling mode. Distance angle limit : Angle difference for various tool inclinations between two separate machining areas (for example: drilling groups) of a model. If the defined value (default = 91°) is exceeded or it is equal to the defined value, the linking movement between the two machining areas takes place at the height of the clearance plane, even if Clearance distance is defined as the retract mode (Parameters dialog page) (1). If the angle value falls below the defined value, the linking movement takes place at the height of the clearance distance (dialog page: Parameters) (2). If there is no angle change, the tool moves rapidly to clearance distance. Clearance straighten angle : If the angle between the Z axis of the current machining frame and Z axis of the tool is greater than the defined straighten angle (default = 45°), the tool turns to the defined value for the straighten angle, after it has reached the clearance plane. If the angle between the Z axis of the current machining frame and Z axis of the tool is smaller than or equal to the defined Straighten angle, the tool moves to the clearance plane without changing the tool inclination (3). The clearance straighten angle provides collision avoidance, in particular for machines with conical interpolation that allow a 180° vector change The straighten angle must be defined so that the tip of the tool describes the deepest point of the entire collision body, including spindle and head.

"body" : "Invert direction by layer : The material application begins after each applied layer on the colder side of the element to be manufactured or repaired. In addition, the direction of the material application is changed from layer to layer. Advantage: even material application, no ‘sagging’ on the colder side. (1) First layer, (2) Second layer. The Invert direction by layer option affects both the Infill and the Peripheral Path . Sorting of the contours when using the option Bottom to top : By layer: If no drive surface is selected, the toolpaths with the same Z value in respect to the job frame are grouped in a layer. If a drive surface is selected the toolpaths with the same distance to the drive surface are grouped in a layer. The contours are afterward grouped by column: This is done by evaluating the distance of the contours on the current layer to the contours of the previous layer. Application : If the Bottom to top option is selected, hyper MILL first applies the material to the contours of the first layer. The same happens in the second layer. The sequence of the contours of the second layer is determined by the column information. The sequence of the contours in the first layer is defined by the sequence of the contours belonging to the first layer in the reference job. Invert column sequence by layer : The deposition sequence of the columns is inverted every second layer. In the example below, in the first layer (A), the material is applied following the sequence: 1, 5, 2, 4, 3. In the second layer (B), the sequence is changed as follows: 5, 1, 4, 2, 3. Advantage : Long repositioning movements can be avoided. Particularly suitable for large parts where the risk of the material overheating during the additive process is low. " },

Setting a higher value ensures that the tool does not collide with the blade surface on the concave blade side.

Constant : Use this option to calculate a lead angle separately for each individual path on the suction and pressure side that can be maintained unchanged across the entire path (1). Variable : Use this option to calculate the best fit of the tool to the surface(s) at all points on the path (2). Free angle (3): Defines the minimum angle to be maintained between the underside of the tool and the blade surface being machined. This function makes it possible to specify a smaller lead angle for machining highly concave blade surfaces, resulting in greater distances between paths. Tilt angle control : Additional slope angle (1) to the side surfaces. This is important if there is a larger allowance present on the hub surface. The turbine blade can be machined close to the hub without touching the hub surface. Normally a tilt angle of 0 degrees is used for calculation. To ensure better milling conditions, a smaller angle-value can be defined. Use the Tangential at edge option to orient the tool in the direction of the edge normals (1).

If a collision cannot be avoided by changing the tool orientation (5X) or tool length calculation, various options are available for the machining strategies: Stop : The toolpath calculation stops when a collision occurs (applies for all machining strategies). Clip : The toolpath is fully calculated. Only the collision-free areas of the toolpaths are output. As a result of rework machining with another tool and\/or another tool inclination, the toolpaths found in the collision can be tracked and checked for collisions (applies to all 3D machining strategies). Collision avoidance : With this option, the tool is side-stepped to avoid collision so that the material can be machined as deeply as possible with the most robust possible tool. The toolpaths calculated for the Clip option are used as the basis for the 3D Rework Machining cycle. An area is determined and graphically displayed within the 3D Automatic Rest Machining cycle. Any further machining occurs within the following cycle only: 3D Automatic Rest Machining . When the Collision avoidance function is used, a milling area that is not within the stock is also protected against collisions.

Edge milling is required if it was not possible to machine this geometry together with the flow areas during flank milling. Fillet Milling This milling strategy can be used to mill the fillets between the blade and bottom surfaces. Fillet milling is used to generate variable fillets or remove remaining rest material. This makes using larger tools to mill blade and hub surfaces more effective. " },

For more information on defining hyper MILL features, see section Feature and macro technology . Basic geometry Number of main blades This value indicates the number of main blades. This figure does not include any existing splitter blades. hyper MILL automatically generates a complete collision model with all blades based on this number. Blade geometry Main blade surfaces \/ Splitter blade surfaces You need to select the surfaces of the main blade and, where available, the surfaces of the splitter. You must always specify the splitter blade (2) as the shorter splitter blade (to the right) located counter clockwise following the main blade (1) . You must select the following for both blades: the main flow areas, surfaces of the leading and trailing edges and optional fillets to the hub. You should only select fillets if it is not possible to generate them directly with the used tool radius. The main flow and edge surfaces need not be trimmed against the hub. However, the distance to the hub must be less than the radius of the smallest tool used. Please note: Depending on the surface data, an additional definition of Blade skeleton curves may be required! Blade skeleton curves Blade skeleton curves limit the so-called skeleton surface. This is an ISO surface that sufficiently corresponds to the blade curvature. Defining curves is optional. They might be required in case of suction as well as pressure side surfaces consist of a patch containing short surfaces, surfaces of leading and\/or trailing edges extend into the suction and\/or pressure side, if suction and\/or pressure surface include leading and\/or trailing edge area (not symmetrically), if the blades get very close to horizontal at leading and\/or trailing edge. Limitations Hub (1) and shroud (2) Select the relevant surface. Both surfaces must form a rotational surface. If the type of surface is different or they are made up of surface segments, you will need to generate these surfaces again. Both surfaces do not need to precisely describe the area to be machined. The surfaces should not be shorter than this area, but they can be longer. Trim curves These curves define the machining area around the respective edge. You will only need to define trim curves if you are going to use the Edge Milling cycle and\/or blade machining with flanks. " },

This means you do not need to select the surfaces into one 3DF file again. To ensure the collision check is correct, however, the system must \"know\" all the surfaces at risk in the machining area. These surfaces can be defined as follows: As a milling area or 3DF file if you want to include these surfaces in the collision check for most operations or as additional surfaces if the surfaces are only relevant to individual machining jobs Check tool Check on : The collision check is required for automatic collision recognition and avoidance. If this feature is not enabled, the system will not correct the tool orientation in the case of a collision! You should only deactivate the collision check if you want to examine the path distribution in advance. It is essential, that you keep this feature activated during all final machining jobs to ensure collision-free milling. Additional shaft allowance : You need to define an additional shaft allowance if the adjacent blades have an even larger allowance during blade milling and there is a risk that they will touch the non-cutting shaft. The value for the additional shaft allowance should be equal at least to the difference between the current allowance and the existing allowance on the adjacent surfaces. Values that are too large will make it difficult to access the stock using thicker (more robust) tools. NC parameters Machining angle tolerance : If both of the machine’s rotary axes are set relatively soft, the tool orientation may deviate slightly from the collision-free orientation that has been calculated. To be on the safe side, you can use this value to internally and conically enlarge the tool and holder by this angle. Values that are too large will make it difficult to access the stock using thicker (more robust) tools.

"body" : "Roughing occurs pocket-by-pocket between the main blades. Different roughing strategies optimize path distribution, tool inclination and the tool length for the machining task. The same applies to the adjustment of the feedrates an area at a time and to several other detail features. By performing various roughing jobs in succession, you can make the best, reliable use of the most robust possible tools in each case. This consequently optimizes machining time as well. Milling strategy The selected milling strategy determines the tool inclination and the axial path distribution. Hub offset :The tool inclination is based on the information about the hub’s vectors. The cut division is calculated as an offset starting from the hub.The cut division is calculated as an offset starting from the hub. Shroud offset (first path) : The cut division is calculated as an offset to the shroud starting from the first path. The paths are trimmed against the hub surface and extended on this surface to the next-highest path. Shroud offset (final path) : The cut division is calculated as an offset starting from the last path. The cut division is calculated from the shroud offset trimmed on the hub surface. Flow : In this strategy, the depth infeed method is the same as with the Blade Point Milling flow option. As roughing can be an exact pre-machining of a subsequent finishing operation, this strategy is particularly useful for machining blisks where alternating roughing and finishing is required in several operations. Infeed strategy The infeed always moves fluidly between the main blades. The path profile follows the fluid flow. Machining is always performed using climb milling. Flow zigzag : Machining with alternating cutting direction between the two main blades. Flow oneway : Machining with the same cutting direction between two main blades. Flow zigzag next : In contrast to Flow zigzag, where the upwards and downwards paths of a pocket are connected with one another from the inside out in a spiral shape, here a link is made to the next direct path in a meander shape. Advantage: Less movement of the rotary axes and therefore of the linear axes. Offset pocket : Pocket-shaped material removal between the blades taking into account the offset values ( hub surface \/ shroud surface ) defined on the Parameters tab. The offset takes place along the outer contour of the pocket, as automatically determined by hyper MILL. This ensures that no remaining material is left in the area on the leading side, which may cause a tool collision during subsequent machining on the trailing side when using the Offset pocket infeed strategy.

"body" : "When machining pockets between the blades, narrower areas can be machined with a smaller tool, while wider areas are machined with a larger tool. This type of pocket split results in significantly shorter machining time and increases the efficiency of machining. For impellers with a splitter blade , hyper MILL specifies the Z value for the delimitation between the upper and lower area automatically based on the size of the splitter blade . The remaining area above the splitter blade is machined with a larger tool, while the two smaller areas between the main and splitter blade are machined with a smaller tool. Pocket split : Impeller with splitter blade. (1) Leading side: Machining with larger tool. (2) Trailing side: Machining with smaller tool. For impellers without a splitter blade , use the Split Z value to specify where the pocket should be divided into an upper (leading side) and lower (trailing side) part. Pocket split : Impeller without splitter blade. (1) Leading side: Machining with smaller tool. (2) Trailing side: Machining with larger tool. The following machining options are available for the pocket split . Off : No pocket split takes place. Both the leading and trailing sides are machined. If a splitter blade is defined, machining takes place both above the splitter blades (leading side) as well as between the main and splitter blade (trailing side). Only lead : Only the area of the leading side will be machined. If a splitter blade is defined, machining takes place above the splitter blade. The area to be machined is calculated by hyper MILL automatically based on the position of the splitter blade. Trailing edge complete : Only the area of the trailing side will be machined. If a splitter blade is defined, machining takes place between the main and splitter blade. The area to be machined is calculated by hyper MILL automatically based on the position of the splitter blade. The Trailing edge complete function can be used in combination with the Offset pocket machining strategy only if roughing has already taken place on the Leading side . This is because the Offset pocket strategy approaches from both the leading and trailing side, and would otherwise result in a collision risk! Split Z value : This option is only available if no splitter blade is defined. This specifies, depending on the defined job frame, the z-height for the pocket split in an area to be machined and an unmachined area. In the case of changes to the frame, the Split Z value must be adjusted appropriately. If on the trailing side the splitter blade features pockets of varying sizes to the left and right, they can be separately machined with the functions Trailing edge left and Trailing edge right and with tools of different sizes.

"body" : "Infeed Max. lateral step : Defines the maximum lateral path distance within a roughing layer. Axial infeed : This value defines the distance between the individual roughing layers (comparable to offset surfaces). Allowances Hub \/ Blade: Defines the remaining minimum allowance on the surfaces. The following applies in the case of a succession of roughing operations: The blade allowance remains constant or increases towards the bottom. In the case of a sequence of shroud strategies, the hub allowance should remain constant. In the case of hub-based strategies, the hub allowance is the lower limit and varies accordingly. The top and bottom limits for the axial machining area are defined differently according to the selected milling strategy (Strategy dialog page). Hub-based strategy (hub offset): The cut division is calculated as an offset starting from the hub. Both offset values can take account of a roughing machining job that has already been performed. Machining area in the axial direction Top limit Shroud offset : Relative value to the shroud A value > 0 defines the depth of a shroud-based machining job that has been performed previously. The value should therefore correspond to the machining depth of the preceding operation. Hub offset : Relative value to the hub surface. This value represents the remaining stock height of a previous roughing job. The stock height is the hub allowance. This value should therefore correspond to the allowance for the preceding job. If you enter a value that is smaller than or equal to the current allowance, this milling area limit will be ignored. In this case, you should enter a value of 0, which corresponds to the default value. Bottom limit The defined offset to the hub serves as the lower limit for the axial machining area. Explanation of the images Complete machining, no limits assigned (both values = 0). The previous machining does not use a bottom limit as an offset to the shroud. A very large allowance was left on the hub. This is typical of hub-based pre-machining. The previous machining job uses a bottom limit as an offset to the shroud. There was no pre-machining with a large allowance on the hub. This is typical for shroud-based pre-machining. Pre-machining jobs were undertaken here. The jobs had both a bottom limit as an offset to the shroud and a large hub allowance. This is typical for a sequence of several roughing operations. Shroud-based Strategies Machining area in the axial direction Shroud offset (first path) : The cut division is calculated as an offset to the shroud starting from the first path. The paths are trimmed against the hub surface and extended on this surface to the next-highest path. Shroud offset (last path) : In this method, the path profile is based on the last layer in the machining area (bottom limit), which is determined from the machining depth and the trimming relative to the hub. The infeeds are then calculated as an offset to this last layer in the direction of the shroud. This means that an operation without a specified bottom limit (input value = 0) produces paths that correspond to those achieved using the hub-based method. Milling area limitation Top limit: shroud offset Relative value to the shroud. This value should correspond to the depth of a previous shroud-based operation. As a consequence, this value should also match the machining depth (bottom limit) for this operation. Bottom limit: shroud offset Relative value to the shroud. The value 0 represents a special case. Here it is assumed that there is to be no depth limit. Example: Shroud offset (first path) Complete machining, no limits assigned (both values = 0). There was no pre-machining. The current operation uses a machining depth limitation as the offset to the shroud. The previous machining job uses a bottom limit as an offset to the shroud. The current operation itself has no machining depth limit. This is typical for shroud-based pre-machining. Both the previous machining job and current operation use a bottom limit as an offset to the shroud. This is typical for a sequence of several shroud-based roughing operations. Example: Shroud offset (last path) Complete machining, no limits assigned (both values = 0). There was no pre-machining. The current operation uses a machining depth limitation as the offset to the shroud. The previous machining job uses a bottom limit as an offset to the shroud. The current operation itself has no machining depth limit. This is typical for shroud-based pre-machining. Both the previous machining job and current operation use a bottom limit as an offset to the shroud. This is typical for a sequence of several shroud-based roughing operations. Path extension Leading edge \/ Trailing edge : The toolpath is tangentially extended on the defined edge. With the help of this value, it is possible to accommodate large stock allowances on the edges. The last path in the roughing is extended over the entire hub. This achieves a uniform allowance for subsequent finishing. You should enable this function if the top limit has been set so deep that only part of the hub will be machined and the preceding roughing job used a tool with a larger tip diameter. Technology: Edge behavior Edge tolerance : The precise traversing of a splitter produces a sharp direction change, which in turn leads to reduced feedrates. If you enter an edge tolerance that is not equal to zero, you can round the path to produce a more gentle movement. Example: (1) Large edge tolerance, (2) Small edge tolerance. Technology: Opening cut To avoid overloading the milling tool, you can limit the maximum axial infeed in the full cut. As an alternative or in addition to this, you can adjust the feedrate and spindle RPM to suit the full cutting conditions. Full cuts only : Available for the infeed strategies Flow zigzag, Flow oneway and Flow zigzag next where the Max. axial stepdown > 0. " },

"body" : "Inclination strategy 4X Machining : Depending on the blade geometry, it may be possible to calculate a fixed tilt for the second rotary axis. Access is then solely achieved by rotating about the Z axis. As of Version 2011, the 4-axis machining strategy in the MB Roughing and MB Hub Finishing cycles is no longer limited to 90 degrees for the 5th axis. You may use any decimal value between 0 and 90 for the tilt angle. Advantage: Higher feedrates can be achieved thanks to the faster interpolation. This drastically reduces machining times. Avoidance strategy Around Z : This option activates the previously used behavior, where the collision avoidance is mainly implemented by pivoting around the Z-axis. Advantage: Very simple movement of the tool that can lead to constant speed of the rotary axes. Camberline : This option activates a new strategy for collision avoidance that is mainly implemented perpendicular to the camberline (centerline) of the blade. Advantage: Tools can be used that are more able to utilize the small spaces between the blades. Result: higher process parameters and reduced machining times! Flank mode If the blade surfaces are suitable, regular surfaces will be derived from the blade geometry. These will be machined with the tool orientation of the Flank milling cycle to achieve an equal allowance of the blades during roughing. The resulting constant cutting conditions may eliminate the need for pre-finishing and reduce the machining time. Machining in the Flank mode can be defined either as Complete machining or only for the last (close to the blade) path . The Flank mode is also available for 4X machining . The swarf cutting orientation is applied only to the last path close to the blade in order to remove the remaining residual stock. Lead angle up \/ Lead angle down The lead angles are defined relative to the vertical positioning of the milling tool on the path. Positive values cause a drawing cut (the tool tip points away from path direction). Negative values cause a plunging cut (the tool tip points in the direction of the movement). The value of the lead angle can be defined separately for upward and downward movements. Global : Global values are defaults that should be achieved across the entire machining area. Local lead angles If you want to maintain locally defined lead angles for the main blade’s leading edge, the splitter blade’s leading edge and the trailing edges, you can enable these defaults manually. In the environment of the selected position, the system interpolates between the local and global lead angle. The collision avoidance can automatically change global and local angles. Smooth factor : The smooth factor can be used to limit the length\/smoothing of the transition between the global and local tool axis settings. This makes it possible to control the area of the drill or upward cuts for both cutting directions independently of each other. Not activated: Global smoothing between the setup at all positions that are shown in the UI. The global value is applied at positions without manually specified local value. Enabled: Changes the lead angle from the global to the local value and back within a length of factor * tool radius. With a small factor, the transition between the specified lead angles can be relatively hard. A larger factor makes the transitions smoother, but can lead to longer drill or upward cuts. Frame angle limitation Max. angle to Z : The frame angle limitation prevents the system from calculating a tool orientation that the machine cannot carry out. " },

The value defines the accuracy with which the calculation for the generation of the toolpaths is carried out. Maximum G1 length (1): maximum length of the G1 movements on planar surfaces which are output in the NC program. Greater distances are subdivided into a corresponding number of G1 movements of the specified length. Controlling the G1 length avoids too strong accelerations of the machine on large planar surfaces. Machining angle tolerance : If both of the machine’s rotary axes are set relatively soft, the tool orientation may deviate slightly from the collision-free orientation that has been calculated. To be on the safe side, you can use this value to internally and conically enlarge the tool and holder by this angle. Values that are too large will make it difficult to access the stock using thicker (more robust) tools. Max. angle increment : Vector density for rapid movements at the clearance distance.

"body" : "The hub is finished pocket-by-pocket between the main blades. Different finishing strategies provide various ways to optimize the calculation of the path distribution and the tool inclination. The same applies to the area-by-area adjustment of the feedrates and to several other detailed features. Milling strategy When finishing, you can choose between complete (Fig. 1) or partial machining (Fig. 2) of the hub. In both cases, the paths follow the flow profile. However, in the case of partial machining, the output of the paths at the edge is limited to a number that has to be specified. This function can therefore be used to carry out rest machining on the hub surface. Optimize : If this option is enabled, every second path on the trailing side is shortened taking into account the Minimum distance . Infeed strategy Machining can be carried out in the same way as for roughing. Flow Paths are interpolated fluidly between the blades and so follow the direction of the flow profile. Flow zigzag : Generates paths from the inside to the outside and is useful when there is a large thickness of material above the hub. Flow zigzag next : Always starts at the selected entry position to the left of the pocket, is shorter and particularly useful when there is a small thickness of material above the hub. Flow oneway : Always starts at the selected entry position to the left of the pocket so that all paths are in climb milling. Offset pocket Paths are calculated as offsets from the blades and trimmed against each other in the center. If Complete machining is enabled, the Opening cut option is provided on the Parameter tab. Feedrate and Spindle speed can then be adjusted to the full cutting conditions of the opening cut. This strategy is only available for parts without splitters or for parts with splitters in Pocket mode. Split Z value : This option is only available if no splitter blade is defined.

"body" : "Inclination strategy 4X Machining : Depending on the blade geometry, it may be possible to calculate a fixed tilt for the second rotary axis. Access is then solely achieved by rotating about the Z axis. As of Version 2011, the 4-axis machining strategy in the MB Roughing and MB Hub Finishing cycles is no longer limited to 90 degrees for the 5th axis. You may use any decimal value between 0 and 90 for the tilt angle. Advantage: Higher feedrates can be achieved thanks to the faster interpolation. This drastically reduces machining times. Avoidance strategy Around Z : This option activates the previously used behavior, where the collision avoidance is mainly implemented by pivoting around the Z-axis. Advantage: Very simple movement of the tool that can lead to constant speed of the rotary axes. Camberline : This option activates a new strategy for collision avoidance that is mainly implemented perpendicular to the camberline (centerline) of the blade. Advantage: Tools can be used that are more able to utilize the small spaces between the blades. Result: higher process parameters and reduced machining times! Lead angle up \/ Lead angle down The lead angles are defined relative to the vertical positioning of the milling tool on the path. Positive values cause a drawing cut (the tool tip points away from path direction). Negative values cause a plunging cut (the tool tip points in the direction of the movement). The value of the lead angle can be defined separately for upward and downward movements. Global : Global values are defaults that should be achieved across the entire machining area. Local lead angles If you want to maintain locally defined lead angles for the main blade’s leading edge, the splitter blade’s leading edge and the trailing edges, you can enable these defaults manually. In the environment of the selected position, the system interpolates between the local and global lead angle. The collision avoidance can automatically change global and local angles. Smooth factor : The smooth factor can be used to limit the length\/smoothing of the transition between the global and local tool axis settings. This makes it possible to control the area of the drill or upward cuts for both cutting directions independently of each other. Not activated: Global smoothing between the setup at all positions that are shown in the UI. The global value is applied at positions without manually specified local value. Enabled: Changes the lead angle from the global to the local value and back within a length of factor * tool radius. With a small factor, the transition between the specified lead angles can be relatively hard. A larger factor makes the transitions smoother, but can lead to longer drill or upward cuts. Frame angle limitation Max. angle to Z : The frame angle limitation prevents the system from calculating a tool orientation that the machine cannot carry out. " },

Radius, height : The radius defines the smooth transition into the lateral movement. The height defines the axial retraction of the milling tool during the transition movement to the next path. To protect the tool tip, the height should be greater than the scallop height that has been generated. Smooth connect factor A smooth transition with horizontal tool steps creates a greater curve radius in the area of the leading and trailing edge . This reduces both machining times and machine wear. Leading edge \/ Trailing edge : The smooth transition can be controlled separately for the Leading and Trailing edge and can assume values between 0 and 1. Values between 0.2 and 0.3 are useful.

The path distance on the blades changes continually where the edges are of a different length. Compared to partial cutting, it takes longer to machine with the same maximum infeed.

"body" : "Inclination strategy 4X Machining : Depending on the blade geometry, it may be possible to calculate a fixed tilt for the second rotary axis. Access is then solely achieved by rotating about the Z axis. Avoidance strategy Around Z : This option activates the previously used behavior, where the collision avoidance is mainly implemented by pivoting around the Z-axis. Advantage: Very simple movement of the tool that can lead to constant speed of the rotary axes. Camberline : This option activates a new strategy for collision avoidance that is mainly implemented perpendicular to the camberline (centerline) of the blade. Special options Close to blade : Facilitates precise tool control near to the blade with optimized inclination and the lowest possible number of axis movements on the machine. Precise avoidance : If this option is enabled, the mesh for collision avoidance will be calculated with approx. 20% greater accuracy than for point calculation of the toolpath, so that even a tool positioned vertically at the blade can typically move without collision between two long and closely placed blades. Edge behavior Min. angle - leading edge \/ Min. angle - trailing edge : Minimum angle that must be maintained on the leading or trailing edges. This helps to optimize the machining of different edge shapes. Intermediate angle down \/ Intermediate angle up Angle to Z : Defined angle of the tool to the Z axis for downwards and\/or upwards movement at the critical location, usually between the main blade and the leading edge on the splitter Iso position (from leading) \/ Iso position (from trailing) : Specify the location where the angle defined relative to the Z axis is to be placed. The advantage of this method is that you may be able to use tools that are better suited for working in the small spaces between the blades.

The link macro connects the toolpaths of both flanks – which are trimmed against the shroud. The Height (1) and Radius (2) define how the link movement is performed over the shroud. Split paths : During 4X Machining, continuous machining around the blade can be obtained by automatically splitting the paths at both edges and connecting these paths again with an additional macro.

Maximum G1 length (1): maximum length of the G1 movements on planar surfaces which are output in the NC program. Greater distances are subdivided into a corresponding number of G1 movements of the specified length. Controlling the G1 length avoids too strong accelerations of the machine on large planar surfaces. Machining angle tolerance : If both of the machine’s rotary axes are set relatively soft, the tool orientation may deviate slightly from the collision-free orientation that has been calculated. To be on the safe side, you can use this value to internally and conically enlarge the tool and holder by this angle. Values that are too large will make it difficult to access the stock using thicker (more robust) tools.

Greater distances are subdivided into a corresponding number of G1 movements of the specified length. Controlling the G1 length avoids too strong accelerations of the machine on large planar surfaces. Machining angle tolerance : If both of the machine’s rotary axes are set relatively soft, the tool orientation may deviate slightly from the collision-free orientation that has been calculated. To be on the safe side, you can use this value to internally and conically enlarge the tool and holder by this angle. Values that are too large will make it difficult to access the stock using thicker (more robust) tools.

OPEN MIND disclaims any liability for damages resulting from the use of demo data in a production environment. Database formats As the MS Access ( .mdb ) format does not support 64-bit technology, it has been changed to SQLite ( .db ) with Version 2011. Please note that SQLite tool databases cannot be protected by passwords at this time. SQLite tool databases cannot be accessed by several users at the same time. This is only possible using SQL Server technology, which is supported as of Version 2014.1. Microsoft ODBC Driver for SQL XX.X If you are using SQL Server databases, ensure that you are also using an up- to-date driver. The name of the driver must read: Microsoft ODBC Driver for SQL XX.X. Do not use drivers with the name SQL Server . This driver cannot transfer more than 400 kB of data to the server. As a result, you cannot use it to store 3D tools in your database. Convert older database to the new format In order to use a database created under Version 2010 and older, you must convert it to the current format. To convert an older database to the current format: First, start your 2010 tool database from the Start menu under Start Programs OPEN MIND Tool database [Version] . Open the database that you want to convert to the new format, select it in the browser and select the Export *.xml function from the shortcut menu by right-clicking. Your old database will be saved in a Neutral tool exchange format that can then be imported with the tool database. Now start your current tool database from the Start menu under Start Programs OPEN MIND Tool database [Version] . Create a new (empty) database ( File New ) and under File type select the format Sqlite database (.db) . In the browser, select the newly created database and then right-click to select the Import function in the shortcut menu. Then select the previously created file in the .xml format that you wish to convert to the new format. The Import status dialog informs you about the current status of the data import. Invalid lengths or duplicate designations are indicated in the Constraint Violation dialog and must be edited. Constraint violations can be resolved by different methods: Automatic : All conflicts occurring during the import will be resolved automatically, so that all elements can be imported from the old to the new database. Ignore : Should only be used by experienced experts. The import continues even if there is no conflict solution. Since the application of this option may result in faulty tools, it is only available if the options Leave , Overwrite and OK are disabled. The Leave\/Leave All : The current element\/all elements of the old database is\/are preserved. Overwrite\/Overwrite All : The current element\/all elements of the old database is\/are overwritten with the new element(s). Deviation : The difference between the element of the old database and the element to be imported is shown. Database files in the *.mdb format will not be deleted after import to the current database format but saved to your system in the same location under the name [ Datenbank_saved.mdb ]. During the import, the tool heads defined in older versions are converted to tool spindles. Consequently, all references are retained. However, the converted tool spindles are no longer displayed in the OPEN MIND tool database. You can nevertheless use them when assembling a tool in hyper MILL. A database conversion is performed when importing tool data from an older version into the current format. This operation should not be stopped, as otherwise hyper MILL will not be able to load any data and joblists and jobs will no longer be available.

"body" : "Calculation rule Meaning Feedrate * factor Define the axial feedrate, for example, based on the regular feedrate using a factor. The feedrate of the individual tool is always taken into account. Constant Use Constant to set a specific parameter to a constant value for all tools in a tool series. The value applies to all tools. Tool diameter sample table Use the Tool diameter sample table to define specific values for individual diameters. The value range between two examples is interpolated linearly. Only the range between the smallest and largest diameter is defined! Tool diameter and corner radius sample table Use the Tool diameter and corner radius sample table to define specific values for individual diameter\/corner radius combinations. The value range between the minimum and maximum values is interpolated. Only the range between the smallest and largest values is defined! Tool diameter and pitch sample table Only available in the  Tapping  type of cut. Use the  Tool diameter and pitch sample table  to define specific values for individual diameter\/pitch combinations. The value range between the minimum and maximum values is interpolated. Tool diameter * factor Based on the tool diameter, use a factor to define the value for the F\/edge parameter, for example. The diameter of the individual tool is taken into account. Cutting length * factor Based on the cutting length of the tool, use a factor to define the value for the Infeed length max parameter, for example. The cutting length of the individual tool is taken into account. Standard material removal rate * factor The calculation rule is only available for the Standard roughing type of cut. The F\/edge for full cuts is derived on the basis of the material removal rate during the standard roughing cut. The feedrate can also be reduced using a factor. Standard adjusted speed formula The calculation rule is only available for the Trochoidal roughing type of cut. Due to the reduced lateral infeed during trochoidal roughing, the tool life increases. The cutting speed is increased accordingly to such an extent that the tool life is maintained in relation to the tool’s reference technology. The Cutting speed formula calculation rule allows tool manufacturers to use their own formulas to adjust the cutting speed. Standard chip thinning formula Use to keep the chip section constant depending on the lateral infeed (Ae). The Feedrate per edge formula calculation rule allows tool manufacturers to use their own formulas to adjust the mean chip section. Stepover formula Use to calculate the Constant stepdown , the Constant stepover , or the 3D stepover based on the Scallop height parameter. " },

If Spindle RPM (n) and Feedrates have been defined for a material, they can be overwritten in the data view of the NC tool and, if necessary, modified through the use of factors. Tool reference : Either Tip or Center can be set as the tool reference for the ball mill, bullnose end mill, lollipop, woodruff, lens cutter and barrel tool types. Tip (1): Z positions in the NC program are relative to the tool tip. center (2): Z positions in the NC program are relative to the tool's center point. Reference points : Available for T-Slot Cutter, Drill Tool, Tap and Boring Bar tool types. Any number of reference points can be defined. Define Name and Position of the reference point. Example : The value for the position of the reference point is based on the tool reference (1). R1 Position = 2, R2 Position = -2. A negative value for the reference point means that this point is moved two units in a negative direction on the Z axis. At the same time, the clearance plane is aligned accordingly. An offset of 0 corresponds to the tool reference. The tool reference must match the tool's measuring system and applies to all 5X and 3D jobs in a job list. Factor speed \/ Factor feedrate : The parameters can be defined irrespective of the material and they are multiplied by the Spindle RPM (n) \/ Feedrate values. The Factor speed parameter is also applied to the Cutting speed (Vc) during turning. Infeed width (ae) factor : Factor on the width of the tool tip used for cutting Infeed length (ap) factor : Factor on the length of the cutting edge used for machining. Maximal spindle RPM \/ Maximal feedrate : Limitation of spindle RPM and feedrate. Factor values and Maximal spindle RPM \/ Maximal feedrate apply to the components Holder and Extension . Factor values are also applied to feedrates in the cutting profile if the feedrate unit is set to mm\/rev or inch\/rev . 5X comp. length : Linear offset as a result of rotating the tool. The distance from the tool reference point to the pivot point is normally composed of a tool-independent and a tool-specific part (comp. length). Usable length : The following applies to drilling tools: Usable length = Cutting length - Tip length. The following applies to tap drills: Usable length = Cutting length - Lead in length. The value can be modified later on. The following apples to all other tool types: The Usable length (5) is determined based on the Tool diameter (1), Tip length (2), Tip angle (3) and Section (4) parameters. Tip angle (3) and Lead in length (4) are calculated based on factor values. For milling tools the following also applies: Usable length = Tip length. If the tool reach is lower than the tip length, the usable length corresponds to the cutting length. Tip angle (3) Tip length \/ Lead in length (4) 80° 0.6 * D (Tool diameter) 118° 0.3 * D (Tool diameter) 130° 0.23 * D (Tool diameter) 140° 0.18 * D (Tool diameter) NC tool length : tool length + holder length. The technology values for the cutting edges and spindle orientation are taken from the selected tool. Material : Material and usage are displayed if they are linked with the selected cutter material. The material and usage are then taken from the selected tool. Spindle RPM (n), Feedrate XY, Axial feedrate, Feedrate reduced, Coolant, Infeed width (ae), Infeed length (ap) and Plunge angle are defined for the tool. The values are material-dependent and can be directly overwritten for the NC tool. To overwrite the parameters, click the corresponding input field (1). If the value is linked (2), click the input field and then click the icon (3) to break the link. Enter the required value. Meaning of the icons Value is linked with tool. Unlink.

This service only works if it is set up on the same computer on which the hyper MILL tool database is located. If the OPEN MIND tool database is running on an SQL server, this limitation can be circumvented as follows: An SQL Server login must be created on the server. For this purpose Server authentication (Security Properties on the server node in Management Studio) must allow Server logins on the server, not only Windows Autentication . When creating the DSN file With SQL Server authentication ... select and enter User and Password. After creating the DSN file, the password must be entered manually in the DSN file: PWD = ... . The service requires read and write access to the file exchange directory used in order to be able to perform its task. Please note that the service uses the restricted account of local Windows services. You may have to grant this account the necessary rights.

Withdraw and retract movements and machine stop are entered prior to separation. Cylinder Barrel Settings in this category are only required in the specific case of 2.5D cylinder barrel machining. This requires a special postprocessor. Program halt Enter commands in the NC file that trigger a program halt at critical points. Under Mode , specify whether these commands should be inserted before or after a tool change. Commands : Enter the commands you want to insert in the NC file. NCS transformation Define a predetermined offset for the NCS. First, the rotation is executed, followed by the displacement. Thus, a displacement refers to the rotated NCS. A warning is issued in this context when loading data in hyper VIEW and during the postprocessor run. Select the Enabled checkbox to turn the NCS transformation on. X offset moves the NCS in the direction of the X axis, Y offset in the direction of the Y axis and Z offset in the direction of the Z axis. A value must be entered for the required distance. Rotary axis determines the axis of the NCS around which the NCS is to be turned. Rotation angle defines the value for the rotation. It is applied only if the rotation axis has the value x , y or z . Collision check Only available in the Machine properties dialog. Collision check options for the simulation. Select the Enabled checkbox below the required option in order to enable it. Tolerance and color can be specified for each individual option. All other information, such as machine, stock and so on, are taken from the first NC job in the hyper VIEW browser. Machine simulation Collision check mode : Only available with a standard postprocessor. Use the Off , On and Head against table options to control collision checking between the machine components for machine models in *.mmb format. Off : The movements between the machine components are not checked for collisions. On : The movements between the machine components are checked for collisions. Head against table Only the movements between the head and the table of the machine are checked for collisions. Tool spindle alignment Arbitrary tool spindle alignment : When this option is enabled, the tool spindle angle is not checked during the postprocessor run. When the option is disabled, the tool spindle alignment is checked during the postprocessor run in relation to the orientation of the X axis of the job frame. If the tool spindle alignment deviates, a message appears, indicating by how many degrees it deviates. In the context of performing back boring actions, this function is used to check whether the alignment of the tool spindle of turning tools is identical to the alignment of the X axis of the job frame before the tool moves eccentrically into and out of the hole.

Tables are suitable to graphically structure the overall output of a report, as well as to list the individual values of a dataset.

The header area can be used to e.g. display the headings of a tabular list, while the values can be specified as a placeholder using a loop ( xsl:for-each ) in the rows ( tr ) and columns ( td ) of a table body. In this way, you can generate a tabular list of the used tools with the respective tool properties. Another function of tables is to specify the display areas inside a page. To do so, the dimensions of the columns are specified explicitly, e.g. a table with a width of 100% can be divided into three columns with widths of 25%, 50% and 25%. It is alternatively possible to specify widths in pixels using the abbreviation px . In this way, the user can divide the page into several display areas and position images or text ranges as needed.

A list of jobs can be visualized in a number of ways, e.g. as an overview in a table or as a list of pages, each of which shows an individual job. For display, it is first necessary to create a loop to cover all jobs in the job list. In the first example case, this loop is used to display the table rows. In the second case, each iteration of the loop displays an entire page. Loops are available under the Insert > For all ... menu item. Because tables with a loop structure are required in many cases, the Tools menu contains the Dynamic table menu item to bring these common steps together in one place.

"body" : "New post processor I have got a new post processor. How to proceed? Follow notes Please pay attention to the notes that are enclosed with the postprocessor delivery. If necessary, please consult your OPEN MIND partner. Installation For information on installing a postprocessor, see section Set up machine . Adapt configuration file Before using the postprocessor for the first time, please adapt all parameters of the configuration file ( *.def file) belonging to the postprocessor that are especially important for your purposes. The adaptation of the configuration file is a continuous process. Depending on the frequency of the usage of the postprocessor with different tool path files, this process can take several months, if necessary. Testing Please test the new postprocessor with typical toolpaths [according to your usual requirements]. Please don't use a current project for this, but (if possible) please use preferably a workpiece, which is not used for commercial purposes. If only a commercial workpiece is available, please only use toolpaths that maintain a defined distance to the workpiece for testing. First, please test single toolpaths, i.e., single jobs without tool changes. Afterwards, the testing procedure can be enhanced and the single jobs tested before, can be tested with machining priority including tool change. Post processor update I have received an update of an post processor. How to proceed? To implement the current changes of your post processor, please proceed as follows: Back up Please first back up the existing postprocessor files to prevent them from being unintentionally overwritten by the newly provided postprocessor files. Doing so means that the original postprocessor files will be available as backup files further on. Apply adjustments to update Please also include the adjustments made to the postprocessor's configuration file(s) in the postprocessor update. If necessary, please consult your OPEN MIND partner. The configuration file is a text file. You can compare the updated file with the existing file und let display the differences into a textfile editor. Adjust specified path If you saved the updated postprocessor files (oma files) in another directory (different from the directory usually used) or if you renamed the updated file, you also need to adjust the path in the machine administration of hyper VIEW (on the hyper VIEW menu in Edit Machine administration New General Machine properties Postprocessor ). Please always save the updated files in a separate directory to prevent them from being overwritten by accident. Please inform the administrator of your hyper MILL installation about the updated postprocessor, so that the administrator can use the latest postprocessor file for subsequent installations, for example, after a new hyper MILL release. If the updated postprocessor is used by a number of people in your company, all the people concerned should be informed about every update. Testing Postprocessor updates have to be tested (as is the case with new postprocessors). Automatic postprocessor updates Are updates automatically shipped? No. Updates are neither generated automatically nor shipped. Therefore you should contact your OPEN MIND partner once a year, to find out about the availability of a postprocessor update. Adjustments to the postprocessor I want to have a adjustment of the NC output of the post processor? How to proceed? Please contact your OPEN MIND partner. The information, named in the following is required for handling your request: Which postprocessor should be updated? Please use the function in hyper VIEW Machine properties Postprocessor Info . You can copy all the information shown in the Postprocessor Information dialog directly to the clipboard and save it to a text file. Create hvz file (including NC file). Please generate an hvz file from all operations (jobs) that you have postprocessed together. Please make sure to generate this hvz file after postprocessing in order to ensure that the corresponding NC file exists. Document desired changes. Please document the desired change using a specific hyper MILL project and inform your OPEN MIND partner in detail about all functions you wish to have in the new postprocessor. For this purpose, please generate a new NC file and also a text file that describes the desired changes (please use the corresponding machine and\/or the CNC control manuals, if necessary). Please note: Adjustments to a postprocessor may incur additional fees! Your OPEN MIND partner will inform you, before expenses are incurred. CAD file In some cases, the CAD file (including job list) from which you generated the hvz file (see section b) may be required. Please also provide this data to your OPEN MIND partner on request. Postprocessor and new hyper MILL Do I have to install a new postprocessor after a new hyper MILL release? OPEN MIND endeavors to ensure compatibility with existing postprocessors with its new releases. However, you can check the behavior of the postprocessors after the introduction of a new hyper MILL release. We recommend doing this based on the last project that was edited and postprocessed before the new hyper MILL release went live. If the toolpaths are not recalculated in the new hyper MILL release, the new hyper MILL release should generate exactly the same NC programs. Furthermore, OPEN MIND recommends that you check the toolpaths typically used in your applications. Examples: If you primarily program 2D toolpaths with hyper MILL, you should check some of the 2D toolpaths. If you primarily generate 5X machinings, please compare some 5X toolpaths. However, if the results deviate from the usual NC output in a new release, please first check if the postprocessor files last provided for hyper MILL were installed by your administrator when the new hyper MILL release was implemented. Please also contact your OPEN MIND partner and inform him or her about this incompatible behavior following the installation of a new hyper MILL release. Your OPEN MIND partner will analyze the incompatible behavior and provide further information. Furthermore, after installing a new hyper MILL release, you should check whether a new postprocessor release is also be available. Postprocessor and new dongle What is to consider when exchanging the dongle? If you don't have new post processor files, please contact your OPEN MIND partner and provide all current dongle information. Please note: it may take a number of days to provide you with these files. " },

"body" : "---------------------------- 2006-Jan-27 Copyright 1996-2002, 2006 by David Turner, Robert Wilhelm, and Werner Lemberg Introduction ============ The FreeType Project is distributed in several archive packages; some of them may contain, in addition to the FreeType font engine, various tools and contributions which rely on, or relate to, the FreeType Project. This license applies to all files found in such packages, and which do not fall under their own explicit license. The license affects thus the FreeType font engine, the test programs, documentation and makefiles, at the very least. This license was inspired by the BSD, Artistic, and IJG (Independent JPEG Group) licenses, which all encourage inclusion and use of free software in commercial and freeware products alike. As a consequence, its main points are that: o We don't promise that this software works. However, we will be interested in any kind of bug reports. (`as is' distribution) o You can use this software for whatever you want, in parts or full form, without having to pay us. (`royalty-free' usage) o You may not pretend that you wrote this software. If you use it, or only parts of it, in a program, you must acknowledge somewhere in your documentation that you have used the FreeType code. (`credits') We specifically permit and encourage the inclusion of this software, with or without modifications, in commercial products. We disclaim all warranties covering The FreeType Project and assume no liability related to The FreeType Project. Finally, many people asked us for a preferred form for a credit\/disclaimer to use in compliance with this license. We thus encourage you to use the following text: \"\"\" Portions of this software are copyright © <year> The FreeType Project (www.freetype.org). All rights reserved. \"\"\" Please replace <year> with the value from the FreeType version you actually use. Legal Terms =========== 0. Definitions -------------- Throughout this license, the terms `package', `FreeType Project', and `FreeType archive' refer to the set of files originally distributed by the authors (David Turner, Robert Wilhelm, and Werner Lemberg) as the `FreeType Project', be they named as alpha, beta or final release. `You' refers to the licensee, or person using the project, where `using' is a generic term including compiling the project's source code as well as linking it to form a `program' or `executable'. This program is referred to as `a program using the FreeType engine'. This license applies to all files distributed in the original FreeType Project, including all source code, binaries and documentation, unless otherwise stated in the file in its original, unmodified form as distributed in the original archive. If you are unsure whether or not a particular file is covered by this license, you must contact us to verify this. The FreeType Project is copyright (C) 1996-2000 by David Turner, Robert Wilhelm, and Werner Lemberg. All rights reserved except as specified below. 1. No Warranty -------------- THE FREETYPE PROJECT IS PROVIDED `AS IS' WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE. IN NO EVENT WILL ANY OF THE AUTHORS OR COPYRIGHT HOLDERS BE LIABLE FOR ANY DAMAGES CAUSED BY THE USE OR THE INABILITY TO USE, OF THE FREETYPE PROJECT. 2. Redistribution ----------------- This license grants a worldwide, royalty-free, perpetual and irrevocable right and license to use, execute, perform, compile, display, copy, create derivative works of, distribute and sublicense the FreeType Project (in both source and object code forms) and derivative works thereof for any purpose; and to authorize others to exercise some or all of the rights granted herein, subject to the following conditions: o Redistribution of source code must retain this license file (`FTL.TXT') unaltered; any additions, deletions or changes to the original files must be clearly indicated in accompanying documentation. The copyright notices of the unaltered, original files must be preserved in all copies of source files. o Redistribution in binary form must provide a disclaimer that states that the software is based in part of the work of the FreeType Team, in the distribution documentation. We also encourage you to put an URL to the FreeType web page in your documentation, though this isn't mandatory. These conditions apply to any software derived from or based on the FreeType Project, not just the unmodified files. If you use our work, you must acknowledge us. However, no fee need be paid to us. 3. Advertising -------------- Neither the FreeType authors and contributors nor you shall use the name of the other for commercial, advertising, or promotional purposes without specific prior written permission. We suggest, but do not require, that you use one or more of the following phrases to refer to this software in your documentation or advertising materials: `FreeType Project', `FreeType Engine', `FreeType library', or `FreeType Distribution'. As you have not signed this license, you are not required to accept it. However, as the FreeType Project is copyrighted material, only this license, or another one contracted with the authors, grants you the right to use, distribute, and modify it. Therefore, by using, distributing, or modifying the FreeType Project, you indicate that you understand and accept all the terms of this license. 4. Contacts ----------- There are two mailing lists related to FreeType: o freetype@nongnu.org Discusses general use and applications of FreeType, as well as future and wanted additions to the library and distribution. If you are looking for support, start in this list if you haven't found anything to help you in the documentation. o freetype-devel@nongnu.org Discusses bugs, as well as engine internals, design issues, specific licenses, porting, etc. Our home page can be found at http:\/\/www.freetype.org " },

The GNU General Public License version 2, found in `GPLv2.TXT' (any later version can be used also), for programs which already use the GPL. Note that the FTL is incompatible with GPLv2 due to its advertisement clause. The contributed BDF and PCF drivers come with a license similar to that of the X Window System. It is compatible to the above two licenses (see file src\/bdf\/README and src\/pcf\/README). The gzip module uses the zlib license (see src\/gzip\/zlib.h) which too is compatible to the above two licenses.

To build the latest development sources: git clone git:\/\/github.com\/stevengj\/nlopt cd nlopt sh autogen.sh make (To build from git, you will need GNU autoconf, automake, and libtool installed, along with SWIG and Unix tools such as m4, perl, and sed.) Once it is installed, `#include <nlopt.h>` in your C\/C++ programs and link it with `-lnlopt -lm`. You may need to use the C++ compiler to link in order to include the C++ libraries (which are used internally by NLopt, even though it has a C API). The minimization function, `nlopt_minimize`, is described in the [man page](http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Man_page) (`api\/nlopt_minimize.3`, which is installed by `make install`. See also the manual on our web page. There are also interfaces for Fortran, Python, Matlab, Octave, OCaml, GNU Guile, GNU R, Lua, and Julia. Interfaces for other languages may be added in the future.

GNU LESSER GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE Version 3, 29 June 2007 Copyright (C) 2007 Free Software Foundation, Inc. <http:\/\/fsf.org\/> Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies of this license document, but changing it is not allowed. This version of the GNU Lesser General Public License incorporates the terms and conditions of version 3 of the GNU General Public License, supplemented by the additional permissions listed below. 0. Additional Definitions. As used herein, \"this License\" refers to version 3 of the GNU Lesser General Public License, and the \"GNU GPL\" refers to version 3 of the GNU General Public License. \"The Library\" refers to a covered work governed by this License, other than an Application or a Combined Work as defined below. An \"Application\" is any work that makes use of an interface provided by the Library, but which is not otherwise based on the Library. Defining a subclass of a class defined by the Library is deemed a mode of using an interface provided by the Library. A \"Combined Work\" is a work produced by combining or linking an Application with the Library. The particular version of the Library with which the Combined Work was made is also called the \"Linked Version\". The \"Minimal Corresponding Source\" for a Combined Work means the Corresponding Source for the Combined Work, excluding any source code for portions of the Combined Work that, considered in isolation, are based on the Application, and not on the Linked Version. The \"Corresponding Application Code\" for a Combined Work means the object code and\/or source code for the Application, including any data and utility programs needed for reproducing the Combined Work from the Application, but excluding the System Libraries of the Combined Work. 1. Exception to Section 3 of the GNU GPL. You may convey a covered work under sections 3 and 4 of this License without being bound by section 3 of the GNU GPL. 2. Conveying Modified Versions. If you modify a copy of the Library, and, in your modifications, a facility refers to a function or data to be supplied by an Application that uses the facility (other than as an argument passed when the facility is invoked), then you may convey a copy of the modified version: a) under this License, provided that you make a good faith effort to ensure that, in the event an Application does not supply the function or data, the facility still operates, and performs whatever part of its purpose remains meaningful, or b) under the GNU GPL, with none of the additional permissions of this License applicable to that copy. 3. Object Code Incorporating Material from Library Header Files. The object code form of an Application may incorporate material from a header file that is part of the Library. You may convey such object code under terms of your choice, provided that, if the incorporated material is not limited to numerical parameters, data structure layouts and accessors, or small macros, inline functions and templates(ten or fewer lines in length), you do both of the following: a) Give prominent notice with each copy of the object code that the Library is used in it and that the Library and its use are covered by this License. b) Accompany the object code with a copy of the GNU GPL and this license document. 4. Combined Works. You may convey a Combined Work under terms of your choice that, taken together, effectively do not restrict modification of the portions of the Library contained in the Combined Work and reverse engineering for debugging such modifications, if you also do each of the following: a) Give prominent notice with each copy of the Combined Work that the Library is used in it and that the Library and its use are covered by this License. b) Accompany the Combined Work with a copy of the GNU GPL and this license document. c) For a Combined Work that displays copyright notices during execution, include the copyright notice for the Library among these notices, as well as a reference directing the user to the copies of the GNU GPL and this license document. d) Do one of the following: 0) Convey the Minimal Corresponding Source under the terms of this License, and the Corresponding Application Code in a form suitable for, and under terms that permit, the user to recombine or relink the Application with a modified version of the Linked Version to produce a modified Combined Work, in the manner specified by section 6 of the GNU GPL for conveying Corresponding Source. 1) Use a suitable shared library mechanism for linking with the Library. A suitable mechanism is one that (a) uses at run time a copy of the Library already present on the user's computer system, and (b) will operate properly with a modified version of the Library that is interface-compatible with the Linked Version. e) Provide Installation Information, but only if you would otherwise be required to provide such information under section 6 of the GNU GPL, and only to the extent that such information is necessary to install and execute a modified version of the Combined Work produced by recombining or relinking the Application with a modified version of the Linked Version. (If you use option 4d0, the Installation Information must accompany the Minimal Corresponding Source and Corresponding Application Code. If you use option 4d1, you must provide the Installation Information in the manner specified by section 6 of the GNU GPL for conveying Corresponding Source.) 5. Combined Libraries. You may place library facilities that are a work based on the Library side by side in a single library together with other library facilities that are not Applications and are not covered by this License, and convey such a combined library under terms of your choice, if you do both of the following: a) Accompany the combined library with a copy of the same work based on the Library, uncombined with any other library facilities, conveyed under the terms of this License. b) Give prominent notice with the combined library that part of it is a work based on the Library, and explaining where to find the accompanying uncombined form of the same work. 6. Revised Versions of the GNU Lesser General Public License. The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and\/or new versions of the GNU Lesser General Public License from time to time. Such new versions will be similar in spirit to the present version, but may differ in detail to address new problems or concerns. Each version is given a distinguishing version number. If the Library as you received it specifies that a certain numbered version of the GNU Lesser General Public License \"or any later version\" applies to it, you have the option of following the terms and conditions either of that published version or of any later version published by the Free Software Foundation. If the Library as you received it does not specify a version number of the GNU Lesser General Public License, you may choose any version of the GNU Lesser General Public License ever published by the Free Software Foundation. If the Library as you received it specifies that a proxy can decide whether future versions of the GNU Lesser General Public License shall apply, that proxy's public statement of acceptance of any version is permanent authorization for you to choose that version for the Library.
