Switch to the mini dialog box using the TAB key If the input field is not active for an entry, the value is displayed rounded. During an input, a value is displayed fully accurately. Angles can be input as deg:min:sec or deg min sec (separated by spaces) and will then be converted to the selected format. Tooltip The entity ID, type and geometric attributes, for example, can be displayed for dynamically highlighted entities. A workplane can be identified via its name. Switching on is possible under Options / properties , configuring is possible under File Options Tooltip content . An error message can also be shown in a tooltip when directly selecting entities or positions during dimensioning, for example. Cursor The cursor changes its appearance in various commands to show that a command is active. Cursor types (examples) Cursor Command Explanation Incorporate A 'pipette' for incorporating attributes, e.g. in the Selection tab. Click the entity with the left mouse button. Hide The Hide command is active. Unhide The Unhide command is active. Delete The Delete command is active: If entities are selected, they are deleted.

In Windows File Explorer, system information can be determined for hyper MILL ® *.hmc documents and *.hmct templates.

PLM Connector Browser PLM Connector The hyper MILL ® PLM Connector is a software application that provides an interface between a PLM system and OPEN MIND software. This software makes it possible to search for documents directly in the PLM system. CAD documents can be downloaded to the local computer to perform CAM programming with hyper MILL ® . All hyper MILL ® project data is automatically combined, added to the PLM system, and versioned there. The complexity of a PLM system is reduced to the level required for CAM programming. The hyper MILL ® PLM Connector can be adjusted to a large extent to the requirements of a company and the individual configuration of a PLM system.

The PLM system itself must be adapted in order to be able to create a data object that can contain hyper MILL ® data. A software installer is provided for this purpose. The hyper MILL ® PLM Connector supports the PTC Windchill PLM system. Support for other PLM systems is available on request. Data must be organized into projects before it can be automatically combined.

Select the 3DxWare SDK4 option to support the current functionality. Selection radius : Size of the area in which an entity is selected if it has not been selected precisely. Endless rotation : The view continues to be rotated automatically after initiation until the user stops the process. The acceleration of the mouse during initiation determines the speed of rotation. Dynamic render mode : Determines whether the existing render mode is changed during rotation. Allows you to choose the render mode you require. Dynamic rotation type : Cylindrical rotates the view around the axes of the screen. Spherical rotates the view around the center. Rotation angular speed : Specifies the angle around which the view rotates when the mouse is moved from left edge to right edge during rotation. Rotation center mode : Determine the navigation behavior when the view is rotated. Select how the center of rotation is to be found. The Enhanced ray cast option defines the standard behavior. A beam is “cast” at the mouse pointer position to find entities. If there are no entities at the mouse pointer position, the center of the view volume is used. The Fit command aligns the center of rotation with the center of the bounding box of the model. The Ray cast option corresponds to Enhanced ray cast , but the Fit command updates the center of rotation in the middle of the view. If the Compatibility option is selected, the previous behavior up to version 2024 is retained for reasons of compatibility with Ranorex tests (for quality assurance of software programming) or for nostalgics. In this case, the behavior depends on the view. In spherical view, the center of rotation is kept in the middle of the view by the Open Inventor graphics engine, while in cylindrical view the center of rotation is found in the same way as with the Enhanced ray cast option. Update rotation center : The rotation center is updated when Zoom in or when Dynamic rotation starts, using the mouse pointer position. Show rotation center : Mark the rotation center point around which the display rotates. If Always is selected, the rotation center point is permanently displayed in the graphics area. If Never is selected, the center of rotation point is not displayed. The selection Manually set only is used to display the rotation center point if it was set manually with the Set rotation target command. The manually set center of rotation point is displayed in red, the implicitly set point is displayed in green. Also see Set rotation center. Invert zoom : Changes the zoom direction for zooming with SHIFT + right mouse button. Zooming into an image normally takes place when the mouse is moved downwards. If this option has been selected, you zoom out when you move the mouse downwards. Invert mouse wheel zoom : Invert the direction of the zoom when zooming with the mouse wheel. Mouse wheel zoom factor : Change the mouse wheel zoom speed. The value 1 is equivalent to the settings from the operating system. Values between 0.1 and 1 make zooming slower. Values between 1 and 10 accelerate zooming. Keyboard pan step : Step size for panning with the keyboard. Keyboard rotate step : Step size for rotating with the keyboard. Keyboard zoom step : Step size for zooming with the keyboard. Select a value between 1 and 180 (default setting: 30). Avoid highlighted entities overlap effects : Avoid visual effects on highlighted overlapping entities. Warning, this process requires considerable processing power.

Direct interfaces for reading the CAD data from different manufacturers are available as an option. Options Options control the import process. The choice of options depends on the original software and the direct interface that is used. The RGB value of the imported color is added to the imported colors for color information. Color information from various sources is combined on this basis. Product and Manufacturing Information (PMI) can be imported for various interface formats. The PMI is displayed and inserted as editable entities (text, dimensions and vector graphics) in the model tree on the Model tab. For this purpose, go to Filter entities and select the Product and Manufacturing Information (PMI) option. To display the PMI, the ‘MyriadCAD’ font is required as the standard font in Windows. Install the font as administrator for all users. The MyriadCAD.otf file is located in C:\\Program Files\\OPEN MIND\\hyperCAD-S\\[Version]\\bin\\converters\\cad interfaces\\[Version]\\resource\\Font . This font can be changed in PMI font the option of the settings when opening via a direct interface. Options for opening data via a direct interface Property Description Filter entities Include entity types and information specifically during import. Solid conversion mode Break solids into faces : Solids are broken into faces and faces are transferred. The original layer assignment is retained. Collect solid faces into groups : The original layer assignment is retained. Collect solid faces into layers : The original layer assignment is lost when combining on layers. Create solid : Solids are created again for solids that exist in the original system. The original layer assignment is retained. In ...\\bin\\converters\\cad interfaces\\hcntCR_HE.ini , the value sld_tol_sf can be changed in order to use a different tolerance when closing a solid in relation to the precision of the entity. Entity conversion modes Convert hidden entities : Include hidden entities during import. Create 3D boundaries : Generate curve entities from face boundaries. Convert all faces to NURBS : All analytical faces are converted to NURBS geometry. Split closed faces : Select whether closed faces should be divided into two faces or imported as a single face. Import of CAD features in hyperMILL : Import CAM-relevant CAD feature information and store as a feature. Merge meshes : When selecting No , no merging will take place; choosing Merge to one activates merging and creates an overall mesh; choosing Merge by colors merges meshes based on their color. Multiple colors will result in multiple meshes. Start hyperMILL feature recognition after model import : Feature recognition is performed automatically directly after importing the data. Model conversion mode Create model structure : Generate the model structure of the model again. The result may differ from the original model structure. Assembly conversion mode Select parts : In a dialog , select from a list which individual parts are to be imported and which are not to be imported. Mark the individual parts to be imported in the list. Import parts without assembly feature : If a Part 01 (one file) and Part 02 (another file) are, for example, intersected with a hole in the external CAD system, this hole feature is modelled in the assembly file (a third file). You can choose whether to import such features. File Automatic saving after opening : After the import process, automatically save the document with the original file name. Conversion tolerance Entity precision : Points within the specified tolerance are handled as a single point. This is a purely mathematical issue and does not concern “point” geometric entities. Layer assignment Starting layer for faces : Specify starting layer for combining on layers during the Solid conversion of faces. Continue layer count : When importing another model into the same document, the layer count is continued and does not start again at the defined starting layer. Set all layers non-selectable : The entities of all imported layers are set to non-selectable. By setting all layers to non-selectable directly before opening the file, the performance of handling imported data is improved. Individual layers can then be activated later as required for specific processes. Log file Log file mode : Same as input file : Save the log file with the file name of the model in the same folder as the model file. Select path : Select another folder for the log file. Select file : Specify a different file name for the log file. None : Do not generate a log file. Log file path : Specify a path for the log file. Log file name : Specify a file name for the log file. Show log file after import : If a log file is generated, automatically display the file after import. Color conversion mode Create colors : Evaluate color and create new color. Map colors : Evaluate color and assign most similar existing color. Healing Enable healing : Repair defective solids (the Create solid option is enabled) and defective faces (the Filter entities Faces option is enabled). The repair is only carried out for things that can be repaired. Remove faces less / equal to area (mm² / inch²) : Discard faces with an area less than or equal to that specified during import. If 0 is entered, no faces are discarded. Remove faces with width less / equal (mm/inch) : Enter a value for skipping Sliver faces during import – these are line-shaped faces that have no impact on the model geometry. Entering 0 means that all line-shaped faces are accepted. Multiple models Models : Select models , import All models or Current model . Different configurations Configuration : Select All , Select or Current . Advanced Optimize edges for solid creation : Advanced optimization calculations for generating closed solids. Template Merge : Insert CAD data to be imported into a hyper MILL ® document template. hyperMILL document template name (*.hmct) : Select document template.

Zero parallax balance : The parallax makes it possible to correct the scene distortion in relation to the monitor level. Adjust the parallax at the monitor level so that a point of an object appears at exactly the same position in the images for both the left and the right eye. The perspective projection in Toggle projection is recommended to improve the realism of the scene. It is recommended to set the synchronization of the monitor to a refresh rate greater than 120 Hz.

When the curvatures are analyzed, no direction information is displayed. This is also not necessary here as the same radius exists for each direction of the sphere. This type of analysis is not really suitable for barrel cutters, for example, in the case of low-angle swarf cutting, as two radii of the tool with significantly different sizes are to be considered. For selectable positions, it is possible to determine whether collision-free machining is possible for the following parameters: Barrel radius Machining direction Lead angle The following procedure may be suggested for an analysis: For the analysis, enable the display of Principal radius 1 and Principal radius 2 . Display the global minimum radius. A position is generated. Snap this position with the analysis tripod. Set the Angle according to the planned machining direction, for example, set the value 0° for machining along the U or V isoparametric line. Check whether the displayed radii suit the planned tool. Check whether a more suitable radius (of another tool) could result in better machining. If a radius that is too small is chosen, the benefits offered by machining with a barrel cutter will be lost. If a radius that is too large is chosen, this will provoke a collision between the tool and the contour to be machined. Change the angle to find a direction for the inclination of the tool (lead angle) that provides a radius that suits the planned tool. Alternatively, change the planned machining direction. In other words, instead of machining in the direction of an isoparametric line, machine in another direction in which the radius of the tool can ‘nestle’ against the contour to be machined without any danger of collision.

The Z axis is mirrored, and either the X axis or the Y axis is realigned based on the right-hand side. The resulting workplane must not be associative with the original workplane. NC programming of nearly mirrored workpieces is simplified. For completely mirror-image workpieces, program the “right side” for milling and mirror all cycles with CAM. However, if a workpiece is only very close to being a mirror image, it is not possible to proceed in this way. How should users proceed in this case? Mirror the workplane used on the “right-hand side” of the near mirror-image workpiece in an aligned manner. This mirrored workplane is then given a new frame, and the cycles can be applied to the new frame.

Define a mating pair relationship between individual faces, groups and solids. This should be a stepwise process. Once the two faces have been selected and the identified relationship is correct, confirm the result by clicking Apply and create the next mating pair. The mating pairs appear on the Model tab. The software will automatically attempt to suggest a meaningful relationship for a mating pair. This depends on the selected entities. As an example, two cylinders will be arranged to be Concentric . For two planes, for example, Coincident will be assumed automatically. This suggestion can then be changed to Parallel , for example, and a Distance can be inserted. To mate multiple faces together, collect the faces into a group. To mate meshes, collect the meshes and faces together into a group. Place the faces on the mesh in advance so that they can be used as mating aids for the mesh. The relationships between multiple solids and groups can be established in any order. Persistent : Permanently save the relationship defined between a mating pair. Otherwise, the entities will only be moved and/or rotated. When moving entities, the relationships saved as mating pairs are observed. If a group or a solid is moved, all child entities will always move with it. In turn, the movement of these groups or solids is only possible within the bounds of the constraints defined for the parent entity. This can mean that a movement executed in the XY direction results in movement only actually occurring in the X direction, for example. A warning is displayed. In direct modeling, affected mating pairs are adjusted automatically. The mating continues to remain in place after direct modeling. When you use Move / Copy and Paste , the matings are also transferred via the clipboard. Using File Save selection , it is possible not to save selected mating pairs or, using File Merge , it is possible not to reimport selected mating pairs.

Curves are converted into a line, circular arc or a series of circular arcs. A series of consecutive circular arc or line segments is generated if a NURBS curve cannot be converted into a single arc. Conversion tolerance : Faces are converted within the conversion tolerance. This means that if, for example, a planar face lies within the specified conversion tolerance, it will become a plane. Otherwise, the face is not converted. Curves are also converted within the conversion tolerance. Angular tolerance : If a series of consecutive circular arc and line segments is generated, the angular tolerance controls the permissible deviation from the mutual tangency. At an angular tolerance of 0, the number of curve segments increases to approximate the selected NURBS curve. At a rough angular tolerance of 20, for example, fewer entities are generated with a lower tangency to one another. Keep attributes : Color attributes are retained. Keep original : Specify whether the selected entities should be retained.

A face cannot be created without a loop – possibly because the selection is incomplete, the boundary has gaps or the contour is not planar. Gaps are identified by red points. Average plane allows you to also create the face on the basis of a curved 3D boundary set. This is recommended for contours that are almost planar, for example. Distance shows the maximum distance between the average plane and the boundary set.

View Hide / unhide Show V-sketch constraints Options for the Sketch and V-sketch commands File Options Sketcher options There are three types of constraint: Implicit constraint An implicit constraint is always recognized automatically by the software. It is not marked with a symbol. An implicit constraint arises, for example, when a curve end point and a curve start point match, in other words, both points are coincident. Geometric constraint A geometric constraint must be assigned manually. The V-sketch is adjusted accordingly. The constraints should be able to be applied in a meaningful way. The software can search automatically for geometric constraints. Geometric constraints are marked with symbols. These symbols indicate the type of constraint. Dimensional constraint The dimensions in a V-sketch. Modifying a measure in a dimension assigned to entities changes the geometry of the entity accordingly. A V-sketch can be created in the following sequence: Create the curve entities, for example, using the Drafting Sketch command. Convert these entities to a V-sketch entity using the Drafting V-sketch Create / modify command. In the model tree on the Model tab, the selected entities are added to his V-sketch entity. Using the Drafting V-sketch Automatic constraints command, geometric constraints are determined from the existing position of the entities to each other. This is also a possible option in the Create / modify command. Using the Drafting V-sketch Geometric constraints command, further geometric constraints between entities are defined. The selected constraint may change the position of the entities relative to each other. Dimension a V-sketch to be able to vary it: Make sure that the V-sketch entities and their constraints are present in the desired form. Call the Drafting V-sketch Dimensional constraints command and insert a dimension for all geometric properties of the entities that are to be modified later on. This is also a possible option for radii in the Automatic constraints command. To modify the V-sketch, double-click with the left mouse button on a measure or call the Drafting V-sketch Change dimensional constraint command and select the measure. Generate a variable optionally under Edit Spreadsheet . Use this variable as a value for a dimension. Vary the V-sketch by changing the value of the variable in the parameter list. The geometry of a V-sketch can be modified subsequently: Variant A Use a command to modify the geometry, for example, Fillet , to insert a fillet. Permit the selection on the Selection tab to select an entity within the V-sketch. Then call the Create / modify command and select the V-sketch. Gaps and over-defined areas are marked by red points. Make corrections. Click the left mouse button and press the CTRL key at the same time to separate entities from the V-sketch. Variant B Change the V-sketch interactively. Make sure that the selection within the V-sketch entity is permitted. Double-click a curve within the V-sketch with the left mouse button. Generate the required shape of the V-sketch using the preview. Click once with the left mouse button or press ENTER to confirm the entry. When the cursor rests on a dimension or a curve, the related entities are highlighted in color. Make sure that the selection within the V-sketch entity is permitted. Change the position of a dimension using the Edit Move text / dimension command. Remove a constraint within a V-sketch using the Edit Delete command. Call the command and select the symbol of the constraint using the left mouse button. Make sure that the selection within the V-sketch entity is permitted. Delete a V-sketch using the Edit Break command. The entities are retained. Redundancy – if there are two identical symbols on an entity, it can be assumed that a redundant relationship has been created. To check, allow the selection within the V-sketch and rest the cursor on one of the symbols. The related entities are highlighted. If they are the same entities, one of the redundant relationships can be removed. Number of Degrees of Freedom - The number of degrees of freedom of a V-Sketch can be determined in analysis Element properties . It is also possible to include the number of degrees of freedom in the tooltip.

Edit Parametric Rebuild parametric model Switch automatic rebuild on and off after a change in the parametric design. Edit Parametric Automatic rebuild on / off Difference between direct modeling and parametric modeling There are two basic procedures: Case A : Import of an existing CAD model from third party CAD software Direct modeling is required as a functionality, as a static CAD model is always present following the import. Changes can be made to the model during work preparation, which do not interfere with the “basic structure” of the construction. These include inserting fillets, deleting fillets or pockets. Converting an imported model to a parametric model enables new features to subsequently be created. The basic (imported) entities do however remain static. After switching to parametric modelling, direct modelling can no longer be performed. A mixed situation occurs. This mixed situation is supported. Direct modeling is not possible on a parametric CAD model! Case B : Reconstruction of a CAD model in hyper MILL ® In the case of a reconstruction, the methods of parametric modeling can be worked with from the offset. A basic change to the construction can therefore also be subsequently introduced. However, information on parameters can neither be exported nor imported. It can only be based within CAD software. Limitations with direct modeling In the case of direct modeling, there are a number of limitations which cannot be overcome based on the methodology used. A significant limitation is that faces and edges within a solid, which are lost by a change, cannot be restored by a further change. One ‘contact’ is always required for the ‘Re-trim’ principle. A section curve must therefore always be found. Consequently, the basic structure of the model can no longer be changed by direct modeling. Limitations with direct modeling - example Starting with parametric modeling Activate the Enable parametric modeling option in File Options Solid editing options . If parametric modeling is activated, the menu bar will be shown in orange. The option state is not saved in the *.hmc document. The parametric feature creation and parametric commands are deactivated if the option is disabled. It is also possible to activate parameters in existing static documents. A parametric feature cannot be deleted if the option is disabled. It is also not possible to perform a Roll back / Roll forward if the option is deactivated. Icon in the upper toolbar (state for off and on) For each parametric modeling a V-sketch is first of all required, on which further modeling steps can be based. Changes in geometry are reported, hyper MILL ® jobs are accordingly marked (the right lower tick becomes a question mark ). Parametric entities and their state are marked in the model tree on the Model tab. a deactivated feature parametric solids and parametric features The model has been modified in such a way that the feature cannot be updated. a failed feature Roll back / roll forward Move forwards or backwards in the model tree. This takes place automatically if an entity in the construction history is changed with Change parameters . If the change has been completed, the last state is automatically restored. The Roll back / roll forward of the modeling step sequence in the model structure is not Undo / Redo . The sequence is also saved in *.hmc , for example. Roll back and roll forward in comparison to the procedure for direct modeling Automatic Roll back and Roll forward during parametric modeling: A Roll back is automatically executed up to the point when the selected entity was created. After the large radius is changed, all of the following steps are re-applied. Procedure for direct modeling: First of all, all the fillets of the two edges need to be removed before the large radius can then be changed by direct modeling. The fillet steps must then be executed once again. Always model fillets at the end! Firstly create the large fillets, then the small fillets. If necessary, the Roll back and Roll forward commands can be used to manually return to a certain point in the model tree in order to determine the state of the affected entity at this time or to export this state. Whereby the subsequent modeling steps are discarded. A static solid cannot be positioned directly in a parametric model. Add a group for such a solid. Position this group to the parametric model. Further information Influencing the shape of a solid by changing the angle value – example Interaction of V-sketch and feature to parametrically model a solid based on the rotational slot feature example, which is used for ‘cutting’. Performing a parametric Boolean operation – example Create V-sketches and define the dimensional constraint with a variable from the spreadsheet. Create solids, for example, with a linear extrusion. Perform a Boolean operation, for example, Difference. Vary the variable in the spreadsheet. The parametric modeling adapts. Removing static entities by adding a parametric feature - example A hole which is present as a cylinder entity should be removed from a static solid. Convert solid to parametric. Create a contour line around the cylinder entity. Convert this contour line to a V-sketch. For example, call the Linear protrusion command, select the V-sketch and the top face of the solid. Enter a height, which corresponds to the height of the solid. The cylinder entity is removed and replaced by a feature, which does not occur in the model geometry in the graphic area. The settings are saved in the file .../hyperCAD-S/files/factorysettings/applicationParametricProperties.xml to globally activate parametric modelling in company-wide default settings.

Changes can be made interactively by dragging the handles and the manipulator. The shape of the selected entities and / or all other faces and features that are linked to the selected entities is adjusted automatically. If faces become or remain a part of a solid, the faces will be highlighted (in red) in the preview. Direct modeling is not possible on a parametric CAD model! The procedure follows these principles: Use direct modeling for features and faces in solids that were modelled directly in the software. Direct modeling also works for a feature within a feature, such as a fillet in a slot . Direct modeling can also be used for imported or static (with no construction history) solids . In this case, all faces, such as fillets, must be removed beforehand in such a way that the next accurate trim edge can be found automatically during the calculation. The calculation cannot be performed without a trim edge. When direct modeling is used with features that are modelled directly in the software, existing fillet features and chamfer features within a feature are not modified as well. They are generated automatically at the new position . A feature can be modified via direct modeling or using the “Change parameters” command. After direct modeling, the feature is broken up. Direct modeling can only be used on solids that are open or closed. Various options are available for direct modeling. These include: Delete a CAD feature or delete faces (no CAD feature) in the shape of a chamfer or fillet from a solid after selecting the entities with the DEL key. The solid is closed automatically. Modify features, for example, using ‘Edit > Move / copy’ . Modify faces within a solid, for example, using ‘Edit > Move / copy’. Mirror features using ‘Edit > Mirror’ . To modify the size of a chamfer or fillet , for example, double-click the feature. Alternatively, create an entity first and then edit it afterwards. To do this, select the entity, call up the Change parameters command on the context menu and modify the entity using the handles. The More parameters command on the context menu opens a dialog for adjusting all attributes and options. Split faces within solids using curves. Modify a separated partial face, for example, using Edit Move / copy . Faces can be moved inside a solid into target faces that are not connected to the initial face .

Electrodes Derive and milling Start milling NC programming for a derived electrode. Electrodes Milling Program the measurement of the derived electrodes (license-dependent). Certa Systems QMeasure A tool electrode is divided into sections. It consists of erosion faces with the contact faces as the faces at the highest point of the erosion face area. There are three extensions of the electrode shaft, the reduction with the reduction top face , the block as the remainder of the raw material and the electrode holder . The electrode can optionally be fitted with a joint to create a side electrode, which makes it possible to reach otherwise inaccessible areas of the geometry. An electrode can be moved and rotated along an eroding path. The eroding path can be spatial. The head of an eroding machine can be used for the collision check. The movement of the electrode can be simulated in an eroding machine model and checked for collisions. The generation of an electrode is based on a 1:1 scaling of the model geometry. It is not possible to change the scaling. All values, such as the start and end points as well as the dimensions in the electrode documentation, are therefore generated. An electrode is non-parametric and non-associative to the information about the electrode that is carried in TAGs. If changes are made to the geometry of an electrode after it has been generated, this can lead to incorrect tag values and must be checked and corrected accordingly. The following changes should no longer be made after the first electrode generation, as these changes no longer have any influence on existing values and therefore imply incorrect values. Transformation of the EDM workplane Transformation of the electrode workplane Transformation of all solids or faces within the electrode group Transformation of the workpiece Prepare the model geometry to derive electrodes. The undersizes (spark gap) are created by milling. The erosion faces thereby correspond to the model geometry. Features such as holes and breakthroughs inside a Domain (with a single continuous face boundary) are optionally closed during derivation, meaning they are not included when generating the electrode geometry . Exclude other breakthroughs (that is, those with multiple face boundaries) manually using auxiliary faces . Some preparatory work is necessary. Information about the purpose of the faces is managed using an electrode color palette. Read in these colors using the Import colors command, or modify the *.hmct document template: In the Electrode options , preset the usually used properties for the construction of the electrode, the technology and the reference system. A suitable electrode holder is searched for in the electrode holder library when designing an electrode. Enter all combinations of electrode holders and raw materials possible for manufacturing into the electrode holder library with the Electrode holder and raw material editor . After the preparatory work, carry out the following steps for designing electrodes. Electrodes can be constructed from volume and face models. The solid, open solid and face entities plus models mixed from these entities are permitted as the reference geometry. Determine an area for an electrode by selecting faces of the model geometry , by limiting with a 2D chain of curves or manually prepare the electrode geometry directly . Imported CAD geometry data often does not have the quality required to create an electrode. Despite undercut and missing faces, gaps between faces, and overlapping faces, the software allows electrodes to be created on the basis of such CAD geometry data. A warning is only issued if the electrode geometry does not specify a closed shape. It is up to the user to assess whether such a situation will have a negative impact on the generation, NC programming, and production of the electrode, and whether it needs to be corrected in advance. Determine areas to be eroded with the help of the Analysis Shape spherical command. The Create or Create user defined commands can be used to merge the electrode geometry and the calculations for the dimensions of the raw material and the electrode holder to form a complete electrode . Use the Create partial command to convert the faces prepared for an electrode into a electrode geometry . In doing so, the electrode block and electrode holder are not yet allocated. The length of the raw material in Z is calculated based on the size of the erosion faces, the shaft length with any correction necessitated by collision avoidance and the safety distance , the reduction, the block and the clamping depth of the raw material in the electrode holder. The dimensions of the raw material in X and Y are influenced by the size of the erosion faces, optionally optimized by rotating the electrode – using Optimized C angle for the best fit. The width of the spark gap, a negative dimension, is not taken into consideration. Based on these dimensions, a raw material that is suitable for X and Y or the diameter is searched for in the *.holders.xml electrode holder library and then the appropriate Z length of this raw material is selected. This results in the assigned electrode holder. If there is no sufficient Z length, the system moves on to the next larger raw material. The necessary shaft length for the safety distance is calculated again for each search step. The overhang of the raw material can be controlled using the Raw material Z length option . Rotate an electrode to combine roughing and finishing electrodes for an electrode holder. For this purpose, use the Rotational option of the Create command to place multiple identical electrode geometries on an electrode block. For an identical or mirrored workpiece geometry, break the electrode geometry out from a complete electrode, reposition it using Edit Mirror and Edit Move / copy and attach it to an electrode holder again using Create user defined . Manage identical electrodes at various positions as references (virtual electrodes) to a master electrode . For this purpose, use the Edit Move / copy command to copy the electrodes to the positions and then use the Virtual electrode command to convert them to virtual electrodes. The target position for the erosion process is calculated. An eroding path can be made visible and changed to influence the movement of the electrode through the workpiece and the erosion movement during the erosion process. The initial situation is the situation after the generation of an electrode in which an electrode is moved back and forth from three positions on the same eroding path. This eroding path can be changed so that an electrode can also be moved back and forth on the same eroding path from more than three positions or moved from a start position to a target position. The electrode can be rotated selectively or continuously. Dimensioning and TAGs can be used to document the values in the electrode overview. Use the Derive and milling command to view the electrodes individually in *.hmc documents for the milling NC programming. Electrode measurement can be integrated into the programming process with hyper MILL ® Electrode , and is supported for the CERTA ® QMeasure software. This is only available with the corresponding licence. Use the Export to EDM command to output the data for eroding and convert it into a specific file format for specific eroding machines.

With the Simplified mode, it is also possible to move the electrode holder in the Z axis lower than the highest plane of the raw material. An electrode holder for side electrodes can therefore be placed lower down. These two options are not available in the Create command. If the Automatic target position is switched off there, the electrode holder can only be moved in the XY plane as far as the raw material covers the electrode. Here the raw material follows the movements of the electrode holder. In this case, it is not possible to move in the Z axis lower than the highest plane of the raw material.

Only as long as the lock is present can the software inform that the workpiece is being used for eroding and should not be changed. It is advisable to lock the workpiece again after making a change. To lock the part again, reassign the eroding reference to all faces and select the existing name. Add faces to expand the collision model Faces can be added to a collision model by adding TAG information. Determine the value of a face’s TAG that already belongs to the desired collision model. To do this, select this face (not a whole solid!) and open the command TAGs Edit info . There, search for the TAG T_ELECTRODE_PART_FOR_EDM_* in the TAG name column. Where * is a variable part of the TAG name that was assigned when the collision model was created. Determine the value in the Value column and note it. In the tab sheet TAGs in the tree structure, find the TAG TAGs T_ELECTRODE_CATEGORY T_ELECTRODE_PART_FOR_EDM_* again. Right-click to open the context menu and select the Assign command. Within this command, select the faces to be added to the collision model. And enter the noted value in the line T_ELECTRODE_PART_FOR_EDM_* ! Apply the entries.

This prevents identical electrodes from repeatedly appearing physically in the model, that is, as a group. Instead, a master electrode is managed with reference to virtual electrodes. This way, the same electrode can be programmed for erosion in different positions. How is a virtual electrode created? Call the Move / copy command. Select the master electrode . Make sure to select the entire electrode. For this purpose, activate on the Selection tab the selection of an entire group as an entity. This will create copies of the master electrode, set up as a group in the model tree. Note that this is not an electrode, but only a group containing all the information about the master electrode. Only one copy per copy process can be created, regardless of the number set under Copy It is checked whether a copy collides with the workpiece geometry. A warning is output on the Info tab. All entities – the master electrode and its copies – are locked. To unlock, the copies must be unlocked first. The master electrode can be unlocked only after. If a machine head is assigned to the master electrode, this machine head and its C-axis are fully displayed as unrotated in the preview during rotation. This only applies to this preview! During the collision check, the C-axis geometry is rotated as desired and the rest of the machine head geometry is regarded as fixed . Then, call the Virtual electrode command .

Virtual electrodes that have been generated are collision checked again if the EDM reference and the machine are present. Use the Virtual electrode command for “Electrode001” to check whether virtual electrodes of the original project A still exist. If necessary, delete these virtual electrodes. Check the description of “Electrode001” using the Modify EDM parameters command. Copy “Electrode001” to the new positions in project B. When copying, the machine head must be visible as a preview if it was created correctly with the master. Otherwise, the machine or the reference position will be missing. In the Virtual electrode command, select the “Electrode001” master. Change the “Copied” property to the “Virtual” property for its electrode copies located in the new position. Select the appropriate EDM reference system. If necessary, hide the “Electrode001” master. Select the virtual electrodes for export without the “Electrode001” master in the Export reports command.

Not available in CAD Viewer and hyper MILL ® SHOP Viewer . A simulation is possible for electrodes that were generated using hyper MILL ® 2019.1 or later. Spark gap : Enter a negative value as a negative, user-defined offset for the electrode. When the electrode is forwarded to the simulation center, the electrode is recalculated. Without this step, the simulation of the electrode path would indicate a collision as soon as the electrode comes into contact with the workpiece because the electrode is generated with the same faces as the workpiece without erosion offset. Without the conversion, it would otherwise not be possible to identify actual collisions. To convert the electrode on the basis of a mesh, the accuracy of the mesh can be influenced with the help of two Windows environment variables. To make the environment variables take effect, restart the software. Do not select an edge length that is too small. Reduce the tolerance for small fillets. If the SIMULATION Center takes too long, the values selected are too small or the mesh is too large to generate. If the offset cannot be generated, a warning message will be displayed. The electrode is then transferred to the simulation without an offset. HC_ELECTRODE_MESH_TESS_TOL : The tessellation tolerance controls the accuracy of the permissible arc approximation. The preset value is 0.005. HC_ELECTRODE_MESH_MAX_EDGE_L : The maximum edge length determines the maximum edge length of the resulting triangles. The default value is 1. The selection of the machine is carried out by using the Machine head for collision check option in the electrode options. The file DIN_ISO.mdf is provided as an ‘empty’ preset for an eroding machine. It is always used when there is no complete machine model *.vmm of an eroding machine available. To obtain such machine models, contact an OPEN MIND sales partner. Instructions for managing the eroding machines during simulation can be found in section Preparing the eroding machine. The entities selected in the Create reference system command under Entities and assigned to the electrode via the selected reference system are used as a workpiece. The graphical representation of the eroding path in the simulation is placed on the lowest point of the electrode in the Z axis direction (like with the milling cutter tip) and not on the reference point of the electrode. The values displayed by the NC program correspond to the actual erosion coordinates. SIMULATION Center - Quick overview of operation Start simulation. Switch on collision check. In the event of a collision, the electrode is colored red, and the model is colored purple. No distinction is made as to whether the collision is due to intentional workpiece contact (at the target position) or due to an actual collision as a result of touching or penetrating the workpiece, such as during rotation around the C-axis. The detected collisions must be analyzed individually. Further information on operation can be found in the SIMULATION Center help section.

Milling areas Faces that are used in milling areas are protected from being modified by the user. The Unlock entities command can be used to disable this protection so that it is possible to edit these faces. A V-sketch can be selected as a machining contour. It is used as a closed polygonal line for job calculations. If the V-sketch is changed (for example, fillets or chamfers are inserted) and the contour line remains closed, the machining contour of the job is updated. However, this only applies if the V-sketch was generated from Version 2021.1. Coordinate system Set WP to frame : Create a coordinate system for multi-side machining ( hyper MILL ® Frame) once or several times for a workplane in the same position and orientation. Link frame to Wp : For an associative workplane in the same position and orientation, create a coordinate system for multi-side machining ( hyper MILL ® ) once and link it to this selected workplane. Only available if parametric modeling is switched on and the workplane is associative. How to Link a coordinate system for multi-side machining ( hyper MILL ® Frame) with a workplane Check whether parametric modeling is switched on. Create a workplane, e.g. with the command Workplane On face . Select the option Associative and enter a name for the workplane. There are two ways to link the workplane to a frame: If the frame already exists: Select a frame and call the Edit command, enable the Associative workplane option in Frame definition Definition , and select the relevant associative workplane from the drop-down menu. If a new frame is required: On the WP tab, select the Link frame to WP command on the context menu of the associative workplane. A new frame is created in the hyper MILL ® frame browser. The Associative workplane option is enabled and the associative workplane is selected. To be able to make a change to the geometry, check whether the Activate option is switched off in hyperMILL Setup Settings in Document Locking . Toolpath entities Toolpath entities are managed without layer information, and do not appear in the model tree on the Model tab. Display settings are not managed as for all CAD entities. Specify settings for toolpath entities: CAM Setup Settings on the Document tab in Feedbacks Colors CAM Setup Settings on the CAD document tab in Toolpath display In the hyper MILL ® job on the General tab Geometric attributes within a toolpath entity can be determined using CAD commands from the Analysis menu. To do this, activate the Toolpath polyline-point snap filter and the Inside toolpath snap option in the Snap selection filter . Toolpath entities are not reflected in the visibility filter on the Visibility tab. Toolpath entities cannot be filtered by color and layer in the Selection filter on the Selection tab. The Edit Graphic properties command does not display any information on the graphic properties of a toolpath entity and its segments. The command cannot be used for a toolpath because a toolpath entity is only managed as a CAM data object. Click a toolpath entity with the left mouse button in the graphics area to select the associated job in the hyper MILL ® browser. Double-click the hyper MILL ® job with the left mouse button to open it for editing. Commands can be run for the selected toolpath entity on the context menu: Select a single toolpath entity: The Modify command is shown. Select one or several toolpath entities: Commands that apply to toolpaths are shown. If no toolpath entity has been selected, no toolpath-related commands are shown.

Partially linked The assignment of a dimension to entities is one-sided. The dependent entity is not modified. Not linked The dimension is not related to entities, for example, because the entities have been deleted.

CNC processing machines often provide the option of probing during and after processing. The date is normally output as text. There is no graphical link to the workpiece. If several attributes and possibly also several workpieces have been probed, it is very difficult to match the results to the correct workpieces in the text file, thus making it difficult to draw correct conclusions. It is a complex task to determine a production trend (e.g., regarding tool wear or the effect of heat-related deformations). There is also the additional difficulty that older CNC controls do not provide any functionality for logging a probing process. As a solution, hyper MILL ® offers to create a mask file in addition to a probing NC file, if this is necessary for the control type. During probing at the machine, a probing log in O pen M ind P robing EX change F ile format is generated as a text file named *.log . This format was designed so that 2D and 3D probing results can be imported to hyper MILL ® and displayed graphically. A probing log is generated for each probing process. This file with the generic name OMPREXF.log , is located in the same folder as the NC file. It is deleted and generated anew when a new probing process is started. This means that the probing log always contains the result of the last probing process. The file is also deleted and newly generated when the process is aborted and restarted. Probing processes can be performed in any order as required. Check the deviations based on the workpiece geometry in the graphics area, in tabular form, and as a trend. For 3D probing jobs, the deviation, meaning the actual state, is determined in the face normal direction of the probing point on the face (target state). In the graphics area, the target and actual states are displayed visually using colored dots with the deviation values. On the Probing tab, sort and filter the results by probing job, probing data, and trends. All values are output in relation to the current workplane. Click a probing point in the graphics area to jump to this point on the Probing tab. The probing results are also displayed if they are covered by other entities. In this case, the measure lines appear dotted and the positions are shown as asterisks instead of circles. The points can always be selected, even if they are obscured by a face, while the label with the measured values can be selected if the selection filter does not include the face. The prerequisite is that the option Create logs for CAD import is enabled in Settings under Probing when creating a job list for probing jobs in the hyper MILL ® job browser. The Create logs for CAD import command is executed via the VIRTUAL Machining Center . The prerequisite for this is a corresponding virtual machine that is activated in the Job list Postprocessor Machine Machine administration dialog and is available for various machine controls. The permissible tolerances are entered in the CAM browser when the probing job is created. The touch probe must be calibrated. Standard logs, such as the standard used by CNC control manufacturer Heidenhain, cannot be processed.

Windows does not automatically support OpenGL accelerated drivers. As a user, you must install a manufacturer or OEM driver to be able to directly use hardware-accelerated OpenGL. These drivers are made available on the websites of most graphics hardware manufacturers. Reference drivers can also be installed for notebook graphics cards. Please note that your notebook manufacturer may offer OEM drivers for your notebook on their website. Please check the website to see if there are any recommended software updates for your notebook. If you have a computer with two graphics cards, select the accelerated graphics card (AMD / NVIDIA) instead of the integrated graphics card in the screen’s Control Panel. In the case of NVIDIA Quadro graphics cards, we recommend that you set the ‘Workstation app - dynamic streaming’ or ‘3D App - Visual Simulation’ profile in the NVIDIA Control Panel. Select the accelerated GPU (AMD / NVIDIA) instead of the integrated GPU in the graphic card settings of a computer with two graphics cards. Please visit the OPEN MIND website and refer to the overview of graphics cards and graphics card drivers recommended for use with  hyper MILL ® . Update your graphics card drivers regularly. The recommended graphics card drivers do not take into account the connection of additional peripheral devices. Connected devices may affect the quality and performance of the graphics card. OPEN MIND Technologies therefore recommends contacting the manufacturer of the hardware in these cases. Windows updates can modify the graphics card drivers and settings without prior notification. We recommend that you check the system after a Windows update. The ...\\hyperCAD-S\\<Version>\\systemchecktool.exe application can help to identify problems. The hardware listed there has been tested automatically for use or is used in daily operations. This does not mean that  hyper MILL ®  will only run on the recommended hardware.  hyper MILL ®  should work on any graphics platform with full implementation of OpenGL.

Therefore,  hyper MILL ®  sets environment variables to adjust the display and thus automatically determines the scaling behavior. This gives the user the benefit of not having to define these environment variables, and it also carries the benefit that Qt-based software programmes are not affected. It is possible to override this behavior by making manual adjustments. To do this, the following options are available: Enlarge the text display. To do this, change the setting in Windows Settings System Display Change the size of texts, apps and other items . For monitors ranging from 27” to 32” (medium sized screens), it is recommended to adjust the font size to 150% first. For very large monitors, the font size can be increased further, for example, to 200%. Please note that if the font size is scaled by more than 150%, the size of the dialogs is doubled. With a large font size, some texts in the user interface dialogs may appear cut off. In this case, the software can be configured to run in Full HD resolution compatibility mode by setting the Overwrite high DPI scaling option for the hmc.exe to System . To do this, right-click the hmc.exe and open Properties in the context menu. In the Compatibility tab, select the Change High DPI Settings button. Select the Overwrite high DPI scaling option and select the System setting from the drop-down menu. In order to be able to work with a 4K monitor while maintaining ultra HD resolution and large font size, the Qt 5 framework has introduced a scaling behavior with the environment variable QT_AUTO_SCREEN_SCALE_FACTOR = 1 . This option scales the Qt-UI objects, such as dialogs, buttons and icons, on high-resolution monitors. The Qt scaling behavior does not affect the 3D rendering window (the graphics area). It retains its resolution. Some elements may then appear too small. The environment variable OMSL_GRAPHICS_ENABLE_PIXEL_RATIO = 1 extends the scaling behavior to the 3D rendering window as well (for manipulators, snap points, workplanes, for example) using the same ratio that Qt calculates for invariant zoom objects. Reduce the 4K Ultra HD resolution from 3840x2160 pixels to the Full HD resolution of 1920x1080 pixels. To do this, change the setting in Windows Settings System Display Screen Resolution . This makes all software programs appear twice as large on the monitor. The space on the screen is reduced accordingly.

It runs as a stand-alone software application. It is used to transfer software settings from one version to another, or from one computer to many others. It can be used for any software based on the hyper MILL ® CAD platform. The commands in File Options Layout manager can also be used within the software. Do not confuse this software with the hyper MILL ® CONFIGURATION Center or SettingsService.exe . When started without parameters, the software settings are copied from the last available version to the latest version. For other software (for example, TOOL Builder ), specify the software on the command line. This works for both registry parameters and roaming settings. Registry parameters are exported to a *.reg file and roaming settings are exported to a user-defined target folder structure. To manage the registry parameters via a *.reg file (Parameter -f ), hcsettingswizard.exe must be run with administrator rights. You can also export to a packed file ( *.7z ) both registry and roaming settings with version information. Then you can import the settings from *.7z file. You can do automatically for the same version or you can specify the destination version. It is up to you do the right thing, No checks of compatibility are done. The *.7z file contains an additional *.txt file with version information. This information is not contained in a *.reg file or in the roaming settings folder structure itself. The roaming settings and the *.reg file itself are independent of the version. The software settings can be imported in any version, if the version is specified at the command line.

This license applies to all files found in such packages, and which do not fall under their own explicit license. The license affects thus the FreeType font engine, the test programs, documentation and makefiles, at the very least. This license was inspired by the BSD, Artistic, and IJG (Independent JPEG Group) licenses, which all encourage inclusion and use of free software in commercial and freeware products alike. As a consequence, its main points are that: o We don't promise that this software works. However, we will be interested in any kind of bug reports. (`as is' distribution) o You can use this software for whatever you want, in parts or full form, without having to pay us. (`royalty-free' usage) o You may not pretend that you wrote this software. If you use it, or only parts of it, in a program, you must acknowledge somewhere in your documentation that you have used the FreeType code. (`credits') We specifically permit and encourage the inclusion of this software, with or without modifications, in commercial products. We disclaim all warranties covering The FreeType Project and assume no liability related to The FreeType Project. Finally, many people asked us for a preferred form for a credit/disclaimer to use in compliance with this license. We thus encourage you to use the following text: \"\"\" Portions of this software are copyright © <year> The FreeType Project (www.freetype.org). All rights reserved. \"\"\" Please replace <year> with the value from the FreeType version you actually use. Legal Terms =========== 0. Definitions -------------- Throughout this license, the terms `package', `FreeType Project', and `FreeType archive' refer to the set of files originally distributed by the authors (David Turner, Robert Wilhelm, and Werner Lemberg) as the `FreeType Project', be they named as alpha, beta or final release. `You' refers to the licensee, or person using the project, where `using' is a generic term including compiling the project's source code as well as linking it to form a `program' or `executable'. This program is referred to as `a program using the FreeType engine'. This license applies to all files distributed in the original FreeType Project, including all source code, binaries and documentation, unless otherwise stated in the file in its original, unmodified form as distributed in the original archive. If you are unsure whether or not a particular file is covered by this license, you must contact us to verify this. The FreeType Project is copyright (C) 1996-2000 by David Turner, Robert Wilhelm, and Werner Lemberg. All rights reserved except as specified below. 1. No Warranty -------------- THE FREETYPE PROJECT IS PROVIDED `AS IS' WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE. IN NO EVENT WILL ANY OF THE AUTHORS OR COPYRIGHT HOLDERS BE LIABLE FOR ANY DAMAGES CAUSED BY THE USE OR THE INABILITY TO USE, OF THE FREETYPE PROJECT. 2. Redistribution ----------------- This license grants a worldwide, royalty-free, perpetual and irrevocable right and license to use, execute, perform, compile, display, copy, create derivative works of, distribute and sublicense the FreeType Project (in both source and object code forms) and derivative works thereof for any purpose; and to authorize others to exercise some or all of the rights granted herein, subject to the following conditions: o Redistribution of source code must retain this license file (`FTL.TXT') unaltered; any additions, deletions or changes to the original files must be clearly indicated in accompanying documentation. The copyright notices of the unaltered, original files must be preserved in all copies of source files. o Redistribution in binary form must provide a disclaimer that states that the software is based in part of the work of the FreeType Team, in the distribution documentation. We also encourage you to put an URL to the FreeType web page in your documentation, though this isn't mandatory. These conditions apply to any software derived from or based on the FreeType Project, not just the unmodified files. If you use our work, you must acknowledge us. However, no fee need be paid to us. 3. Advertising -------------- Neither the FreeType authors and contributors nor you shall use the name of the other for commercial, advertising, or promotional purposes without specific prior written permission. We suggest, but do not require, that you use one or more of the following phrases to refer to this software in your documentation or advertising materials: `FreeType Project', `FreeType Engine', `FreeType library', or `FreeType Distribution'. As you have not signed this license, you are not required to accept it. However, as the FreeType Project is copyrighted material, only this license, or another one contracted with the authors, grants you the right to use, distribute, and modify it. Therefore, by using, distributing, or modifying the FreeType Project, you indicate that you understand and accept all the terms of this license. 4. Contacts ----------- There are two mailing lists related to FreeType: o freetype@nongnu.org Discusses general use and applications of FreeType, as well as future and wanted additions to the library and distribution. If you are looking for support, start in this list if you haven't found anything to help you in the documentation. o freetype-devel@nongnu.org Discusses bugs, as well as engine internals, design issues, specific licenses, porting, etc. Our home page can be found at http://www.freetype.org "},{title:"LICENSE ",url:"UUID-3ff0e53e-24c6-c8fc-09df-9df11f7cb1ca.html#UUID-3ff0e53e-24c6-c8fc-09df-9df11f7cb1ca_section-idm231882460197314",breadcrumbs:"CAD / Appendix / Third Party Software Terms / FreeType / LICENSE ",snippet:"The FreeType 2 font engine is copyrighted work and cannot be used legally without a software license.

The GNU General Public License version 2, found in `GPLv2.TXT' (any later version can be used also), for programs which already use the GPL. Note that the FTL is incompatible with GPLv2 due to its advertisement clause. The contributed BDF and PCF drivers come with a license similar to that of the X Window System. It is compatible to the above two licenses (see file src/bdf/README and src/pcf/README). The gzip module uses the zlib license (see src/gzip/zlib.h) which too is compatible to the above two licenses. The MD5 checksum support (only used for debugging in development builds) is in the public domain.

It is designed as as simple, unified interface and packaging of several free/open-source nonlinear optimization libraries. The latest release and a complete manual may be found at the NLopt home page: http://ab-initio.mit.edu/nlopt It is compiled and installed with the standard GNU autoconf/automake commands: ./configure make make install See `./configure --help` or the `INSTALL` file for other options. To build the latest development sources: git clone git://github.com/stevengj/nlopt cd nlopt sh autogen.sh make (To build from git, you will need GNU autoconf, automake, and libtool installed, along with SWIG and Unix tools such as m4, perl, and sed.) Once it is installed, `#include <nlopt.h>` in your C/C++ programs and link it with `-lnlopt -lm`. You may need to use the C++ compiler to link in order to include the C++ libraries (which are used internally by NLopt, even though it has a C API). The minimization function, `nlopt_minimize`, is described in the [man page](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Man_page) (`api/nlopt_minimize.3`, which is installed by `make install`. See also the manual on our web page. There are also interfaces for Fortran, Python, Matlab, Octave, OCaml, GNU Guile, GNU R, Lua, and Julia. Interfaces for other languages may be added in the future.

See the GNU Lesser General Public License for more details. OPEN MIND Technologies AG hereby offers to deliver or make available, upon request, for a charge no more than the cost of physically performing source distribution, a complete machinereadable copy of the corresponding source code of the Library on a medium customarily used for software interchange. Please contact: info.deutschland@openmind-tech.com. This offer is valid for a period of three years after the date of purchase of this product. GNU LESSER GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE Version 3, 29 June 2007 Copyright (C) 2007 Free Software Foundation, Inc. <http://fsf.org/> Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies of this license document, but changing it is not allowed. This version of the GNU Lesser General Public License incorporates the terms and conditions of version 3 of the GNU General Public License, supplemented by the additional permissions listed below. 0. Additional Definitions. As used herein, "this License" refers to version 3 of the GNU Lesser General Public License, and the "GNU GPL" refers to version 3 of the GNU General Public License. "The Library" refers to a covered work governed by this License, other than an Application or a Combined Work as defined below. An "Application" is any work that makes use of an interface provided by the Library, but which is not otherwise based on the Library. Defining a subclass of a class defined by the Library is deemed a mode of using an interface provided by the Library. A "Combined Work" is a work produced by combining or linking an Application with the Library. The particular version of the Library with which the Combined Work was made is also called the "Linked Version". The "Minimal Corresponding Source" for a Combined Work means the Corresponding Source for the Combined Work, excluding any source code for portions of the Combined Work that, considered in isolation, are based on the Application, and not on the Linked Version. The "Corresponding Application Code" for a Combined Work means the object code and/or source code for the Application, including any data and utility programs needed for reproducing the Combined Work from the Application, but excluding the System Libraries of the Combined Work. 1. Exception to Section 3 of the GNU GPL. You may convey a covered work under sections 3 and 4 of this License without being bound by section 3 of the GNU GPL. 2. Conveying Modified Versions. If you modify a copy of the Library, and, in your modifications, a facility refers to a function or data to be supplied by an Application that uses the facility (other than as an argument passed when the facility is invoked), then you may convey a copy of the modified version: a) under this License, provided that you make a good faith effort to ensure that, in the event an Application does not supply the function or data, the facility still operates, and performs whatever part of its purpose remains meaningful, or b) under the GNU GPL, with none of the additional permissions of this License applicable to that copy. 3. Object Code Incorporating Material from Library Header Files. The object code form of an Application may incorporate material from a header file that is part of the Library. You may convey such object code under terms of your choice, provided that, if the incorporated material is not limited to numerical parameters, data structure layouts and accessors, or small macros, inline functions and templates(ten or fewer lines in length), you do both of the following: a) Give prominent notice with each copy of the object code that the Library is used in it and that the Library and its use are covered by this License. b) Accompany the object code with a copy of the GNU GPL and this license document. 4. Combined Works. You may convey a Combined Work under terms of your choice that, taken together, effectively do not restrict modification of the portions of the Library contained in the Combined Work and reverse engineering for debugging such modifications, if you also do each of the following: a) Give prominent notice with each copy of the Combined Work that the Library is used in it and that the Library and its use are covered by this License. b) Accompany the Combined Work with a copy of the GNU GPL and this license document. c) For a Combined Work that displays copyright notices during execution, include the copyright notice for the Library among these notices, as well as a reference directing the user to the copies of the GNU GPL and this license document. d) Do one of the following: 0) Convey the Minimal Corresponding Source under the terms of this License, and the Corresponding Application Code in a form suitable for, and under terms that permit, the user to recombine or relink the Application with a modified version of the Linked Version to produce a modified Combined Work, in the manner specified by section 6 of the GNU GPL for conveying Corresponding Source. 1) Use a suitable shared library mechanism for linking with the Library. A suitable mechanism is one that (a) uses at run time a copy of the Library already present on the user\'s computer system, and (b) will operate properly with a modified version of the Library that is interface-compatible with the Linked Version. e) Provide Installation Information, but only if you would otherwise be required to provide such information under section 6 of the GNU GPL, and only to the extent that such information is necessary to install and execute a modified version of the Combined Work produced by recombining or relinking the Application with a modified version of the Linked Version. (If you use option 4d0, the Installation Information must accompany the Minimal Corresponding Source and Corresponding Application Code. If you use option 4d1, you must provide the Installation Information in the manner specified by section 6 of the GNU GPL for conveying Corresponding Source.) 5. Combined Libraries. You may place library facilities that are a work based on the Library side by side in a single library together with other library facilities that are not Applications and are not covered by this License, and convey such a combined library under terms of your choice, if you do both of the following: a) Accompany the combined library with a copy of the same work based on the Library, uncombined with any other library facilities, conveyed under the terms of this License. b) Give prominent notice with the combined library that part of it is a work based on the Library, and explaining where to find the accompanying uncombined form of the same work. 6. Revised Versions of the GNU Lesser General Public License. The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new versions of the GNU Lesser General Public License from time to time. Such new versions will be similar in spirit to the present version, but may differ in detail to address new problems or concerns. Each version is given a distinguishing version number. If the Library as you received it specifies that a certain numbered version of the GNU Lesser General Public License "or any later version" applies to it, you have the option of following the terms and conditions either of that published version or of any later version published by the Free Software Foundation. If the Library as you received it does not specify a version number of the GNU Lesser General Public License, you may choose any version of the GNU Lesser General Public License ever published by the Free Software Foundation. If the Library as you received it specifies that a proxy can decide whether future versions of the GNU Lesser General Public License shall apply, that proxy\'s public statement of acceptance of any version is permanent authorization for you to choose that version for the Library.

Modal dialog A modal dialog blocks interaction in another window of the same software as long as it is open. Dialogs which allow you to simultaneously work in other windows of the software are known as modeless. Multi-screen A computer with two or more monitors. Open Inventor Open Inventor is an object-oriented C++ program library used to create 3D graphics with OpenGL. Wildcard character Wildcard characters can be inserted in a pattern string to find a string matching the specified characteristics: * = Matches any combination of permissible characters. ? = Matches any single permissible character. Regular expressions Regular expressions are a form of pattern matching, frequently used when processing text data. The Perl programming language can be used as an example. Regular expressions are a complex search tool that make it possible to intelligently examine text information for strings that match certain patterns. The software searches for a part of a character string that matches the specified regular expression. This means that the system does not check whether the entire text entered matches the regular expression. A part of the text or character string is sufficient. http://perldoc.perl.org/perlre.html#Regular-Expressions (\\d{4}[- ]){3}\\d{4} This regular expression searches for three groups of characters, where each group consists of four figures followed by a hyphen or space, and finally four additional figures. This could be an order number or part number, for example. If the following keyword tags have been assigned to various entities: 1234-5678-0000-00000000, 1111 2222 3333CC, 1234-5678-1111-2222, then all of these tags will be found using the filter condition from the example. Second-level command A second-level command is a command that does not interrupt an active command. Erosion Raw material A workpiece, usually made from copper, graphite or tungsten-copper, intended for further processing to become an electrode for electrical discharge machining. CAD Polyline Entity that represents a group composed of straight line segments. Polylines are not a subcategory of curves. Boundary The boundary is the edge of a face. Domain A domain is an initial face in its state before trimming. Feature CAD feature and hyperMILL feature: hyperMILL feature: Geometries such as holes, pockets, planes, 2D and 3D profiles are recognized automatically, both on faces and solid models. These automatically recognized geometries are known as features. They are generated with all parameters necessary for further CAM processing. The recognized features can be further processed in many ways. For example, jobs or cycles can be assigned to the features, or more complex machining sequences in the form of macros can be generated based on features. Shape A parent object in the model tree, used to improve the sorting of mesh, solid, point cloud and face entity types. Group Entity to combine other entities in the model tree. Edge An edge arises between two connected boundaries within a solid. Continuity This value describes the continuity of curve and face transitions. The software allows a positional transition (G0), a tangential transition (G1) or a curvature constant transition (G2). Mil Thou (abbreviation for a thousandth of an inch) is a length dimension in the imperial and US system of units and the English name for the American mil unit (from Lat. millesimus). 1 thou is a thousandth of an inch, which corresponds to 25.4 µm. 1 mil = 1/1000 in.; 1 mil = 25.4 µm; 1 mil = 25.4 • 10-6 m; Multishell mesh A multishell mesh is a mesh with isolated triangles not connected with the main cluster. NURBS Geometric entity defined using NURBS mathematics. Zone A zone is a CAD feature. Any faces inside a solid can be combined as desired. "}];$(document).trigger("search.ready")});
