Advanced 2025 The AUTOMATION Center Controller makes it possible to structure existing AUTOMATION Center scripts in a meaningful way in order to obtain an overview of their purpose. The scripts can be processed without having to activate AUTOMATION Center separately for each individual script. Automation is considered useful even if there are no workpiece families, as almost every workpiece requires similar process steps, e.g. work preparation and the creation of workshop lists. The AUTOMATION Center Controller can be seen as a toolbox for making processes more efficient. Large scripts can be used multiple times, which is helpful to reduce complexity and allow more flexible handling of existing scripts. A process can be easily interrupted and resumed by means of suitable structuring.

Create associative point : Display and edit point coordinates of hole features relative to a selected frame. Grouping feature : Group together several features with identical parameters. Frame creation mode : Choose 2D to create a feature list for each hole direction to which a frame is assigned. Choose 5X to combine all recognized features in a feature list to which no frame is assigned. In the case of Mixed , multiple holes have the same direction, so a feature list is created for this direction and a frame is assigned to it. All other holes are combined in a feature list to which no frame is assigned. Tolerance : Specifies the accuracy level for transferring the geometric data from the CAD model. Slot tolerance : Enter a distance from which a feature is to be split into two or more features if the cylinders of the geometry under investigation have the same diameters and cylinder axis, but there is free space, for example, a slot, between them. If the distance is smaller, the free space is bridged – only one feature is created. Diameter limit : Enable this option when holes require a diameter limit. Min. segment angle : All cylindrical faces with a segment angle greater than 270° are recognized as holes. A hole that is cut open in the middle has a segment angle of 180°. A rounded inner corner of a rectangular pocket has a segment angle of 90°. If the Min. segment angle were set to less than 90°, every corner of a rectangular pocket with rounded corners would be recognized as a hole. Detect spot depth : Recognized features are checked for spots and any existing spots are displayed accordingly. Check bottom : Recognized features are also checked for bottom spots and any existing spots are displayed accordingly. Check sink : A check is carried out to see if sinks can be machined from the defined direction. Allow NCS as reference : This option sets a global setting in the document. It therefore also has an influence on pocket recognition. Tag used faces : Each face used is tagged. Also see Mark not complete cylinder hole feature faces. Keep CAD features : Enable if a CAD feature for holes should remain associatively linked to the CAM feature after feature mapping.

CHECK: gouge : Report whether collisions have occurred that are classified as a component violation. In a component violation, the cutting part of the (milling) tool causes damage to the workpiece, for example, in the case of an infeed via the part. This renders the workpiece unusable.
