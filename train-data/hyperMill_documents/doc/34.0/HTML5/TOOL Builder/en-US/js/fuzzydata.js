You can use the TOOL Builder to interactively prepare these models so they can be used for calculation, collision checking and simulation. 3D data import and tool entity creation is handled by running a pre-specified series of steps from a toolbar in the TOOL Builder . It is also possible to repeat a command from a previous step. Selected entities, such as the solids for a holder or axes, for example, are automatically labelled with tags and saved to an appropriately named layer. The following tools and tool elements are supported: Turning tool : Holder (with rotationally symmetrical support in the spindle), (Insert) tool holder , Static holder (turning with turret) Milling tool :  Holder,   Extension. Back boring tool : Geometry type   Body and insert, Geometry type  Monobloc By default, tools are assigned the name of the document with which they were created. CAD entities, which are used to define a tool holder, holder, static holder or extension, are locked against further editing. " },
