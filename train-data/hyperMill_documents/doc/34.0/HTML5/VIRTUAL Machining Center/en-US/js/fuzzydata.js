"body" : "The VIRTUAL Machining simulation solution allows machining operations to be reliably evaluated, checked and optimised before the machine run thanks to a virtual mapping of the actual processes. The central component is the VIRTUAL Machining Center software with simulation and analysis options for the NC code following the postprocessor run. The Optimizer module automatically calculates the best solution for multi-axis machining from various possible tool inclinations. The CONNECTED Machining module connects the CAM workstation and machine tool to allow a bidirectional exchange of information between the generation and execution of programs. VIRTUAL Machining Center VIRTUAL Machining Center delivers maximum processing safety. Actual machining operations, including linking movements, are mapped virtually and can be simulated after the postprocessor run completely on the basis of the NC code. The simulation on the virtual machine also takes into account the holder, fixtures and clamps in addition to workpiece and tool. Axes can be moved manually, axis limitations are indicated and limit switch traversals are detected automatically. Each machining operation is checked before any movement on the machine. Machining steps can be simulated individually. Collisions can be detected and therefore avoided. Numerous analysis functions allow machining situations to be thoroughly checked. The best-fit function automatically calculates the optimal placement of the part for the available workspace. This can prevent time-consuming adjustments of the machine setup. Axis diagrams show the traversing movements of the individual axes in detail. Unusual movements can be identified quickly and can be corrected before the program is transferred to the machine.   VIRTUAL Machining Optimizer The VIRTUAL Machining Optimizer module provides support for multi-axis machining. Optimization algorithms calculate the technically best tool positions that allow efficient traverse movements during machining. All selected tool positions are checked for possible collisions, thus guaranteeing a safe machine run. Programming errors are avoided. This means there is no need to make subsequent changes to the machining programs on the machine. CONNECTED Machining The CONNECTED Machining module allows networking and synchronisation with the machine via a bidirectional data exchange with the controller. Data can be sent to the machine and executed there, and data can also be received from the machine. The actual machining is available in the simulation in ‘real time’. Before the machine run, machining and machine configurations, such as zero-point definitions, tool data and machine configuration parameters, are read from the controller and checked against the program data in hyper MILL . The machine run will only start if the data matches and the collision check has been carried out successfully. The NC programs are loaded directly into the memory of the controller. This stops the programs from being mixed up and protects them against unauthorised access. This software documentation provides information on how to use the VIRTUAL Machining Center and CONNECTED Machining software. " },

The tolerance values\/limit values for the still permissible contact of the tool with the part\/stock must be in reasonable proportion to the size of the tool used. OPEN MIND recommends defining these values no larger than half the tool diameter. Check tool against model : Checks the tool against the model. Check holder\/shaft\/core against model : Holder, shank and tool core are checked against the model. Always check G0 : The rapid traverse check is activated by default. If the Check tool against model function is deactivated, the check for all fast travel movements can also be optionally switched off. This can make it easier to approve an NC file in certain situations (for example, when machining non-modelled areas). Check stock : Checks tool and holder against the stock. Remove detached stock : Only available if Check stock is enabled. If this function is activated, a check is performed during the collision check and the simulation to see whether there is a stock area that has no contact with the defined milling area (model). If this is the case, the stock is automatically removed during the simulation and the collision check.
