# Working Data Directory
# 
# This directory is used by the CNC Management System to store all processing outputs,
# logs, and temporary files. The system will automatically create subdirectories here
# during operation:
#
# BRK CNC Management Dashboard/
# ├── jsonscanner/     - JSONScanner processing results
# ├── toolmanager/     - ToolManager processing results  
# ├── dashboard/       - Dashboard application data
# ├── logs/            - System logs
# ├── backups/         - Backup files
# ├── temp/            - Temporary processing files
# └── output/          - Reports and exports
#
# In demo mode, this simulates the customer's chosen working directory.
